            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>That the firſt primary and principal reaſon from whence a Soul may conclude that the Evidences of his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt received are really from God, is, that thoſe Evidencing Beams of Light do proceed from the Bleſſed Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

               <p>THE Apoſtle taking care of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> after his departure from it; writes this Epiſtle for the Eſtabliſhing their Hearts in the Riches of the Lords Free Grace in Chriſt, that the Lord had made their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48673:6"/>
Souls Partakers of, that thereby he might excite and quicken them to all ſutable walking to ſuch Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</p>
               <p>This being his Scope, in this firſt Chapter, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle begins to reckon up all thoſe Glorious Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges by their ſeveral names, in their ſeveral Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and orders; and therefore you ſhall ſee in <hi>ver.</hi> 3. He breaks out in the very beginning into a Holy Rapture of Praiſe and Admiration of God, to Bleſs his name for thoſe high Priviledges, as Election, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, Vocation, and Glorification. Now in <hi>ver,</hi> 8. is comprehended the great Priviledge of their Vocation, in thoſe words <hi>wherein he hath abounded towards us in all Wiſdom and Prudence,</hi> or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; That is, in which Grace and Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named, the Lord hath abounded towards us, through the Communicating that Grace of Wiſdom and Underſtanding to us; That is, that Grace that made us receive and reſt upon the Doctrine of the Wiſdom of God to Salvation. And having thus named the Priviledge it ſelf, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. He opens the manner of the Lords thus effecting this grace upon their Souls, in theſe words, <hi>having made known unto us the Myſtery of his Will, according to his good pleaſure which he had purpoſed in himſelf.</hi> The manner of the effecting of it is by the Lords mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting the Myſteries of his will to their Souls: And what he means by the Myſtery of his will he tells us <hi>ver.</hi> 13, <hi>it is the Word of Truth, the Goſpel of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi> He means indeed the Salvation Preached in and through the Lord Chriſt alone, which was the great Myſtery that the Angels deſired to pry into. Now by the Revelation of this Myſtery the Lord did Communicate that Grace and Underſtanding to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48673:6"/>
them, whereby they did embrace that pretious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that made them wiſe to ſalvation. Now in opening of it, he amplifies it firſt, by the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cauſe in the latter end of verſe 9. which is the Lords <hi>good pleaſure</hi> purely in himſelf: Then he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the ends of the Lords effecting this in this manner; that is, of the Lords revealing the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his will to their ſouls, in theſe words, <hi>That in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of time, he might gather together in one all things in Chriſt, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth, even in him:</hi> Thus you ſee the occaſion of the words: They contain the intended effect, or end the Lord aimed at, in the revelation of the Goſpel of Chriſt to their ſouls. In this intended effect, there are ſeveral things obſervable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The act it ſelf in the producing the effect, that is union of Souls with Chriſt, <hi>[That he might gather together in one:]</hi> Indeed the union is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold: Firſt of all with Chriſt. Secondly, one with another; they are made both one with Chriſt, and one body within themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obſerve here the object upon which this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is to be wrought, in theſe words <hi>[All things:]</hi> The object is laid down in general.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All things,</hi> that is, all perſons predeſtinated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the counſel of the Lords own will, to be his own in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>that he might gather them together in one.</hi> Secondly it is laid down more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, and that by a double diſtribution of the perſons into the ſeveral places where they remain, in thoſe words, <hi>[both which are in heaven, and which are on earth;]</hi> that is to ſay, that the Lord might unite to Jeſus Chriſt, all thoſe that are already ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48673:7"/>
joyned and compleatly united to him in heavenly glory, and all thoſe that are upon the earth, whom the Lord doth intend to bring into that glorious union.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Obſerve here the ſubject with whom this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to be perfected, and that is Chriſt himſelf. He is the very <hi>punctum</hi> as it were, he is that one point in which all theſe are to be gathered together in one.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Here is the time of the accompliſhment of this effect. And that is in the firſt words <hi>[In the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times.]</hi> Thoſe words, <hi>In the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times,</hi> ſeem to have ſome difficulty in them. They are a Metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Adjunct as we uſe to ſpeak, where the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times is put for the various ſucceſſive times, in their own orders vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diſpenced by the wiſdom of God. The meaning is this, In the various ſeaſons purpoſed by God himſelf ſucceſſively, according to the Lords wiſe diſpenſation of thoſe times in their orders, the Lord might thus gather together all to be one in Chriſt. Thus you ſee the words a little opened, and the meaning of them to be briefly this, That the Lord did reveal the myſtery of his own will, that is, the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt to their ſouls for this end; that in the ſucceſſive times that he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed according to the counſel of his own will, as he is diſpenſing them in his own wiſdom, he might gather together all the ſouls of his own to be one in Jeſus Chriſt. There are divers things worthy our obſervation out of theſe words. Firſt, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them as they have dependance upon the former Verſe, and therein we muſt conſider the act it ſelf
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48673:7"/>
named in the effect, and conſider it as the end of the Lords revealing the myſteries of his will, it is <hi>to gather our ſouls to be one in Chriſt.</hi> From thence take notice of this concluſion.</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>That the purpoſe and intent of God, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the truths of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt unto the Souls of men, is, that he might gather together their Souls into union with Jeſus Chriſt, that by vertue of that union they might be one with the Father, as he and Chriſt are one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By tranſgreſſion in the loyns of <hi>Adam,</hi> we are all eſtranged from God, and there was an high wall of ſeparation built up between him and our ſouls; Hence in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21. We are ſaid to be alienated from God, and from the life of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18. But though we have dealt thus unworthily with God, in our breach of union, and deſpiſing communion; the Lords love doth condeſcend ſo low, and the bowels of his compaſſion have been ſo unconceivea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tender, towards poor worthleſs ſinners, that he hath again provided a new and living way, for ſuch ſouls as are ſo departed from him, to have acceſs to himſelf; He hath provided his Son a Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween himſelf and ſuch wretched ſouls, and in and through that one Mediator, through that one <hi>Days-man,</hi> he offers to make himſelf one again with the ſoul. And leaſt Souls ſhould be ignorant of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible kindneſs of his, he hath written a glorious Goſpel by the great Secretary of heaven, diſcovering the pretious workings of his own love, and ſends meſſengers on purpoſe, to proclaim it to every ſoul: And the intent of God in all, is only
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48673:8"/>
this, that he might gather ſouls into union with the Lord Chriſt, that ſo by that union, himſelf and thoſe ſouls may again be one.</p>
               <p>For the opening of this propoſition, there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers queſtions that ſouls would willingly have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>What is this union with Jeſus Christ? What is it to be one with Jeſus Chriſt!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, I muſt anſwer you negatively, what it is not. Secondly, affirmatively ſhew you what the union is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt negatively, what it is not.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not a perſonal union with Jeſus Chriſt, that men are called to by the Goſpel. That we call the hypoſtatical union, which is the union of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature with the divine: Now it is the nature of man in general that Chriſt took upon him, and not the perſon of man, for then there ſhould have been a fourth perſon taken into the Trinity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not an union of dependance. The Lord being the primary being, the firſt being of beings in the world; every thing that hath a being proceeds from God the firſt being, and is preſerved in that being by influences from God: Now ſhould the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of dependance upon God be broken, then the creatures ſhould be broken and fall into nothing: Now in that reſpect all the creatures may be ſaid to have union with God: ſo the pooreſt herb and weed hath an union of dependence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is not the union of preſence, that is, of the Eſſential preſence of God. The Lord being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite being, fills heaven and earth, and is not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed in both; that is, he is not contained in both, but is infinitely in heaven and earth; And the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48673:8"/>
Lord, according to his own being, is as preſent in Hell as in Heaven, in this place as in that place. Now the Lord is in the creatures, and ſo it is called an union of preſence: Every creature ſenſible and unſenſible hath ſuch an union, there is the preſence of God in them: God hath his way in the pooreſt weed that hath a being, and it is impoſſible this ſhould be broken, unleſs the nature of God can be taken away, and the infinite nature of God become finite.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. I ſhall anſwer affirmatively: The uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Lord intends by the revelation of the Goſpel, to bring your ſouls to in Chriſt, is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the ſcriptures name it, <hi>five-fold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. There is an union of agreement, or an union of peace made up between Chriſt and the Soul. This is called in Scripture the reconciliation of the ſoul unto God, and unto Jeſus Chriſt. Then perſons are ſaid to be divided, when there are jars and quarrels taken up by one perſon againſt another: but the removing of theſe quarrels and controverſies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe perſons, is the making thoſe perſons one again. Now this is the caſe between God and the ſoul; there was ſuch a bleſſed harmony and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement between the Soul and God in <hi>Adam,</hi> as there was not the leaſt jar imaginable in Gods bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom againſt us, nor in our boſom againſt God; but through our curſed tranſgreſſion in the loyns of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> we gave God ſuch offence, as he hath a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel againſt all the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> and our hearts have a curſed quarrel againſt God; whence we are ſaid to be enemies in our minds. Now the union God intends to bring the ſoul to in Chriſt, is an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of agreement, that is, the removing all thoſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48673:9"/>
jars and differences between God and the Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is an union of Marriage, or a Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial union. The Lord hath ſuch infinite bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of mercy in his boſom toward ſouls, that when they had deſpiſed that bleſſed union with himſelf, that he had given them by creation, he will make them better again then they were firſt made, by another union: he brings them into a marriage uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to make the Soul a Spouſe to Chriſt, and Chriſt an Husband to the Soul; and that advanceth them in ſome meaſure above the Angels: They are but miniſtring ſpirits to Chriſt, and to the Spouſe of Chriſt: they never had ſuch an honour as to be the Spouſe of Chriſt. This union you find frequently in Scripture; In <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. ſpeaking of marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and wife, ſaith he, <hi>I ſpeak concerning Chriſt and the Church.</hi> So <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.7. and Chap. 21.9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is an union of ſpirit. He will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate of his own ſpirit to the ſoul, and make his wife partake of the ſame ſpirit with himſelf, that the Saints and he ſhall be one ſpirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is the union of likeneſs or ſimilitude, between Chriſt and the Soul. That is, the Lord by the communication of himſelf unto the Soul, makes it to be a lively patern of himſelf. Thence it is that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, he tells us, he had <hi>predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated us to be conformable to the Image of his Son.</hi> Hence he ſaith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>We are partakers of the divine nature;</hi> That is, of the ſame nature that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is partaker of, that there ſhould be an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature between Chriſt and the Soul; that is, an union of holineſs; That as he did partake of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48673:9"/>
humane nature, he will make his Spouſe partake of the divine nature. Nay we are ſaid to partake of the life of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4 18, that is, to live the ſame life of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is the union of headſhip. That is to ſay, to have Jeſus Chriſt as his head, and to be of the ſame body with Jeſus Chriſt: This is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called by men, the myſtical union, becauſe it is an hidden union, that Chriſt and the Soul ſhould be but one Body. This union is thus, that the ſoul ſhould be of the number of thoſe Elect, that the Lord according to the counſel of his will, choſe to be veſſels, to which he would communicate of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to all eternity.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>How can the revelation of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, bring the Soul thus into union with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt? How can the manifeſtation of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Gods will effect ſuch a gracious work as this, to unite the Soul to Chriſt in all thoſe ways?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, Firſt, negatively. Secondly, affirmatively.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We muſt not conceive that the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Goſpel truths, are the original, principal, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe, of this union of Souls with Chriſt, as though this union of Souls with Chriſt did depend onely upon the working of thoſe truths of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt revealed. It is the will of God that is the principal efficient cauſe of union: The Lord hath not left the ſtate of ſouls to be determined by themſelves, either by reſiſting or embracing the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt: and therefore you ſhall ſee in the Verſe before the Text, that the revealing of thoſe truths of the Goſpel, are ſaid to be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the purpoſe of the Lords own will.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither muſt you conceive, that thoſe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48673:10"/>
of the Goſpel do by their own effectual ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue produce this union between the Soul and Chriſt. Faith it ſelf, which is the uniting grace, by which the union is made up, does not produce this union by any vertue, or efficacy, and proper quality in it ſelf, but as God hath determined the revelation of the Goſpel, and ſaith wrought by thoſe revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to bring the ſoul into union.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither do thoſe revelations of the Goſpel to the outward ear work this effect of the Souls uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt. Thence it is ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 6.45. <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that hath learned of the Father cometh unto me:</hi> It is not hearing and learning thoſe truths from the mouth of man, that immediately produce thoſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, but hearing from the Father, that is, by Gods giving inward beams of light to the underſtanding, whereby he doth diſcover the myſteries of his will to the ſoul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 2. I anſwer affirmatively, The revelation of the truth of the Goſpel doth produce this union three ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By diſcovering the union with Chriſt to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Soul-alluring properties of it. It is inſtrumentally that the Lord uſeth the revelation of the truths of the Goſpel to manifeſt to the ſoul that an union is to be obtained, and to manifeſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, beauty, neceſſity, and ſutableneſs of that union to the ſouls preſent condition, whereby the ſoul is drawn to accept of that union. Now in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard union cannot be effected between Chriſt and the Soul, without a diſcovery that there is ſuch an union to be obtained, therefore it is ſaid, the Lord by revealing the truths of the Goſpel to the Soul, does gather the ſoul into union, becauſe this is the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48673:10"/>
onely glaſs as it were, whereby the ſoul may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the way of attaining an union between Chriſt and the Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By conveying ſight to the blinded ſoul, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that union. Though the moſt Orient bright gliſtering colours, be preſented to the eyes of a man covered with darkneſs, they could not take up a mans meditations about them, neither could he be affected with them. Now the eyes of all men naturally are covered with darkneſs, that though the Goſpel hold forth the union, yet we cannot be taken up with it, nor paſs judgment upon it till the eye be opened; Therefore the Goſpel preſents an union to be obtained, and gives eyes to ſee that union. Hence it is ſaid to be part of Chriſts office, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6, 7. to open the eyes of the blind. And thence we are ſaid in 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.2. to receive an underſtanding to know the Lord, and this is done by the revelation of the truths of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By infuſing a diſpoſition into the will to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that union propounded unto the ſoul in Chriſt. The Lord by thoſe inward revelations doth convey an holy inclination into the perverſe obſtinate will, whereby the will is drawn to conſent to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on propounded to the eye of the underſtanding. When once the ſoul hath received a ſpiritual eye, by thoſe revelations of Goſpel truths, to apprehend an union tendered to the ſoul in Chriſt, in the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, excellency, neceſſity, and ſutableneſs of it; that very viſion of that union with the properties of it, doth change the diſpoſition of the ſoul that wrought in oppoſition againſt God formerly, and cauſeth the will to deſire that union propounded in Chriſt: The reaſon is, becauſe then by the light communicated
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48673:11"/>
to the ſoul, by theſe truths revealed, the ſoul ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends that union as the onely chief good, and then the will cannot but cloſe with it and embrace it: Then by the conſent of the will to embrace that union, the union is made up between Chriſt and the ſoul, in the four reſpects mentioned, from whence do neceſſarily follow the union of likeneſs and ſimilitude; And that is made up from thoſe former unions two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of the neceſſary communion that is between Chriſt and the ſoul upon thoſe firſt unions made up. No ſooner does Chriſt become a head to the ſoul, and the ſoul a member of Chriſt by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of will, but ſome influences flow from the head to the members: now thoſe influences are part of his divine nature, part of his holineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The union of likeneſs follows, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining arguments of the underſtanding unto the ſouls likeneſs unto Chriſt. When once the will, through the diſpoſition infuſed into it, by beholding the truths of the Goſpel of Chriſt, conſents; the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding preſently draws ſuch arguments from va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious particulars, or adjuncts, that always attend the union of the Soul with Chriſt, that thence the Soul is conſtrained to a likeneſs to Chriſt. (1.) Then the underſtanding begins to conſtrain the ſoul to a remembrance of the intent of Jeſus Chriſt in uniting the ſoul unto himſelf; Thence the underſtanding compels the ſoul to a full conformity to Chriſt, as you may ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5, 6. <hi>If we have been planted together in the likeneſs of his death,</hi> [that is, if we have partaken of the vertue of the death of Chriſt] <hi>we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſs of his reſurrection:</hi> If we be like Chriſt in his death, we ſhall be like him in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48673:11"/>
his life: How? <hi>Knowing that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of death might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin:</hi> That is thus, Our underſtandings arguing and diſcuſſing thus; If Chriſt died for us, then we have a part in his death, then were our ſins crucified in his death: <hi>knowing this,</hi> [by this diſcuſſive power of the underſtanding] <hi>that our old man is crucified with him;</hi> That is thus, through the apprehenſion of the Lord Jeſus tendered to make ſatisfaction to divine juſtice, for all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries and indignities the ſoul hath offered to him, and the ſoul apprehending a willingneſs in the Lord to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it into union with himſelf in Chriſt, whereby the will conſents to what the Lord propounds to it, then the underſtanding begins to argue thus; what art thou united to Jeſus Chriſt? then the intent of Chriſt is that thou ſhouldeſt be conformable to his Image: and canſt thou walk contrary to Chriſt? (2.) The underſtanding conſtrains from the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of its engagement to be like to Chriſt. Firſt the underſtanding will urge the engagement of Gods honour; If thou beeſt one of Chriſts, then thou art engaged to hold up the name of Chriſt, to bear the Image of Chriſt, to hold forth the likeneſs of Chriſt in thy converſation: thou art to be a golden pillar whereupon the excellency of the Image of Chriſt ſhould be written in great characters. Secondly the union of likeneſs follows, by reaſon of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement and ſutableneſs of the likeneſs of Chriſt to the ſouls diſpoſition. Through the conſent of the will to embrace union propounded with Chriſt, there is ſuch a diſpoſition prevailing in the ſoul, as ſweetly cloſeth with the likeneſs of Chriſt; and it becomes an intolerable burden to the ſoul, that the heart is ſo unlike to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:48673:12"/>Queſt. 3. <hi>Why does the Lord intend by the revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel to bring ſouls into union with Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the anſwering this queſtion, two things muſt firſt be premiſed in general.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is no one act of the Lords will that is the proper efficient cauſe of another act of his will. It is not becauſe Gods will hath determined to bring to paſs one thing, that therefore the Lord doth alſo determine to bring to paſs another thing, as though the firſt act were the cauſe of the ſecond act of Gods will; for Gods will is God himſelf, and ſo according to the ſimple act of Gods will, he wills all things together and at once.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there is nothihg that the Lord determines, that moves inwardly the will of God to determine another thing as the conſequent of that. It is one of the abſolute perfections of the divine Eſſence, that all his operations are dependent in himſelf: yet as ſome things in the order of the creation are effected by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo properly it may be ſaid, the Lord wills one thing for another, that is, the Lord wills one thing to produce ſuch an end: As the Lord wills the Sun, Moon, and Stars, to have an influence into all things below, to preſerve them in their being, and keep the natural vertues communicated to them: Though the influences of the Sun, Moon, and Stars be not the cauſe of Gods will, yet they are willed to that end. Theſe things being premiſed, there are divers ends, which may improperly be called cauſes, of the Lords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, by the revelation of precious Goſpel truths, to bring Souls into union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe the union of God the Father with Souls, is effected by and through the union of the Soul with the Lord Chriſt. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19, 20. <hi>It pleaſed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48673:12"/>
the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwel, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made peace by the blood of his croſs, by him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile all things unto himſelf.</hi> It was by the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Father that all things ſhould be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to himſelf, that ſhould ever be brought to an union of agreement with God: ſo that the mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Son, is that bond of connexion between God and any Soul; As in <hi>Job</hi> 9.33. where <hi>Job</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains he could not come near God, he calls for a <hi>days-man: There is no days-man between us, that he might lay his hand upon us both,</hi> that is, there is no mediator, to mediate between God and me, to bring me near to him: till Jeſus Chriſt become a days-man between God and the Soul, that by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his mediation there is an union made up, God and the Soul ſtand at enmity, there is an high wall of partition built up between God and the Soul. Now becauſe the Lord from eternity determined to bring ſome ſouls into union with himſelf, therefore for the accompliſhing his own will, he intends the Goſpel, inſtrumentally to draw ſouls into union with the Lord Jeſus, for the perfecting union with him: ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. The Lord doth it, That he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate of his own glorious excellencies into ſouls. Now without this union with the Lord Chriſt, there can be no communications of thoſe excellencies into ſouls; though there may be ſome influences into ſouls without this, yet not in that glorious way of communicating himſelf, whereby the Lord intends to make himſelf admired.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Without this union there can be no communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Lords life and image unto ſouls. That is, no communicating of the divine diſpoſitions of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48673:13"/>
his own underſtanding and will, into the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wills of his people, that they ſhould live a ſutable life to his life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Without this union, there can be no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the love of God unto their ſouls. There may be influences of God into ſouls without union, but no influences of love without union, and that in two reſpects. (1.) In regard the diſpleaſure of Juſtice is only removed, through the union of Souls with Chriſt. And before offended Juſtice is appeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there can be nothing but wrath in the boſom of God againſt ſouls. (2.) In regard the Adoption is onely purchaſed by the Lord Chriſt. All the love that the Lord communicates unto any ſoul is fatherly love, the love of Adoption: Now adoption comes onely by Chriſt, who purchaſed Adoption for us, I mean materially, though originally it comes from God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Without this union there can be no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of any mercy. Mercy is love, reſpecting an object as miſerable: Now man, as made miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by Sin, cannot expect the leaſt dram of mercy from God, but by a Mediator, ſuch a Mediator as ſhall ſatisfie Juſtice, Now without union with Chriſt there is no vertue of Mediation conveyed into the ſoul, and thence none of the mercy of God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Without this union, there could be no full communication of the Lord unto Souls. Though indeed the Lord might glorifie himſelf, in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating ſome degrees of his excellency in ſome way, as making himſelf glorious in Juſtice, and though outward mercies be communicated by the influences of his power in protection, and of his wiſdom and providence in ordering things.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:48673:13"/>5. There could be no everlaſting communication of God without union. Were it not for the union of Souls with Chriſt, the ſentence paſt upon ſouls in the loyns of <hi>Adam,</hi> would be a ſentence of death upon them. Now the Lord intends to have eternal glory, by the eternal communication of himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſouls of his Saints, and therefore he intends to draw them into union with Chriſt. This the Lord intends in two reſpects. (1.) In regard the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Gods excellencies are eſſential unto him. It is as natural unto God to be pouring out of his excellencies into ſouls, as it is natural for the Sun to infuſe beams of light upon the creatures. (2.) In regard it is the higheſt delight and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God to be communicating of himſelf unto his creatures. The Lord takes greateſt pleaſure in pouring forth his own fulneſs into the boſoms of empty ſouls, in two reſpects. Firſt, in regard the communication of his excellencies unto ſouls, is the manifeſtation of his own glory. The excellency of God is made known by communicating of it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Then the excellency of his holineſs appears, when it is poured into ſouls; Then love and grace ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, when it is fixed upon the ſoul of a worthleſs worm. Secondly, this communicating of himſelf is the higheſt delight and contentment of God, in regard it is the pouring forth of himſelf into his own beloved objects. It is ſo Eſſential to God to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate of himſelf, that he takes contentment in it, be it to what creature ſoever, be it to an enemy, the Lord delights in the act of it, in regard he attains his own higheſt end, that ever his eye of intention was fixed upon, which is the manifeſtation of his own glory: Much more the Lord takes delight in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating

himſelf to the ſouls of his Saints, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard thoſe are choſen to that end. Now where there is an object beloved, there is always delight in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good to ſuch an object: Therefore the Lord draws ſouls into union with Jeſus Chriſt, that they may be ſutable ſubjects to communicate himſelf to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. The Lord intends to draw ſouls into uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Lord Chriſt, by revealing the truths of the Goſpel, becauſe he hath purpoſed and determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to make the myſtical body of Chriſt, the object of his own delight and contentment to all eternity. (1.) The Lord takes pleaſure in dwelling among them, and manifeſting himſelf to them. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. It is the priviledge of the Saints to have God dwell among them here, much more does the Lord intend to dwell among them to eternity. (2.) The Lord intends they ſhould be his delight, in having ſweet familiarity and precious converſe with them. That converſe properly conſiſts in two things. Firſt, in the Lords opening and revealing to their ſouls, all the ſecrets of his ways and works, that ever were manifeſted in the world, and that in their intended iſſue and effects. That manifeſtation of the beams of his own glory, that ſhined in all his ways, is a kind of familiar talk with the ſouls of his Saints. Secondly, it conſiſts in the Lords being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them familiarly, without terrifying or affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. Then <hi>Job</hi> ſhall have his deſire, Chap. 9.34. <hi>Let not his face terrifie me, &amp;c.</hi> (3.) That their ſouls might have perfect communion with him, conſtant communion, without interruption and intermiſſion. Now when there is a ſutableneſs of the object for the perfection of love, then there is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48673:17"/>
a ſutableneſs for the perfection of delight, it being nothing but love in reſt, or love injoying the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved object.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. The Lord intends this by the Goſpel, to bring ſouls into union, in regard he intends to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the glory of the incomprehenſible riches of his own love, in and through their ſouls. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.7. <hi>Bring forth my Sons and Daughters, that I have cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated for my glory.</hi> Now the Lord accounts the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the riches of his love and compaſſion to poor worthleſs man, to be one of the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, bright ſhining beams of his own glory: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired his glory to paſs before him, he proclaimed his name <hi>the Lord gracious, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="1">1.

Conſider, The neglect of deſiring a conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to this intent of God in the Goſpel is a profanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the precious Ordinance of God, it is a pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the great name of God in his Ordinances.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider what a mockery and diſſimulation thy attendance upon the Goſpel hath been unto God. Every Ordinance of God is appointed for God to be worſhipped in, and thou by thy attending upon an
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48673:18"/>
Ordinance, profeſſeſt thou doſt worſhip God; Now it is impoſſible for a ſoul to worſhip God, whilſt he is ignorant, or regardleſs of the intent of God in an Ordinance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thy neglect of this great intent of God in his Ordinance, is a direct contrary walking unto God. In coming to an Ordinance, thou doſt come with ſome intent or other; It is inſeperable from a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creature upon a deliberate act, to work for ſome end. Now if thou doſt always come with an intent, and haſt neglected the intent of God; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows directly, it is a contrary walking to God.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Hence we may learn what a ſmall number of hearts have had the right effect of the Goſpel of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt upon them. How few hearts can be found who are drawn into union with the Lord Chriſt by the power of the Goſpel this day? How many are careleſs and regardleſs, whether they be one with Chriſt or no?</p>
               <p n="3">III. We may learn hence to behold the working of the heart of God towards us, in propounding of Goſpel truths; it is to bring your ſouls to be one with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Hence learn, that every ſoul that refuſeth the Lord Chriſt tendered, upon what ground ſoever can be imagined, is a rejecter of the Goſpel of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. Many poor ſouls, through the curſed deluſion of the old Serpent the Devil, conceive they do well to ſtand off from receiving the Lord Chriſt tendered in the Goſpel: Take notice of the ſad dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miſcarriage of thy heart, thou neglecteſt the very principal command of God, remaineſt diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, while thou thinkeſt thou goeſt on in a way of obedience.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:48673:18"/>V. Learn what is the general rule, by which we may judge perſons to be embracers, or refuſers of the Goſpel of Chriſt. The general rule is, whether they appear to be made one with Jeſus Chriſt or no. If fruits can manifeſt there is an union with Jeſus Chriſt, then we may judge ſuch to be embracers of Chriſt; But if fruits manifeſt there is no union with Chriſt, then can we not charitably judg that they are embracers of the Goſpel of Chriſt for the preſent.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Hence learn, what the ſum, perfection, and higheſt end of all Scripture is. It is nothing but this, the Lord Chriſt and the ſoul made one. It's Chriſt alone that is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of the Scriptures. Therefore hence we may learn how to read, and hear the Scriptures: The way is to make Chriſt the <hi>pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,</hi> the center of every line, that when we find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Chriſt, we are far from reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Look upon the Types, Ceremonies, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogies, all lead to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Hence learn, what was the end of all thoſe infinite wiſe counſels of God, from before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world was laid. What was the end of all the myſteries of the Goſpel, that the Angels deſire to pry into? The end of all is to bring ſouls into u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Hence learn the reaſon of the near Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of affection between the Lord Chriſt, and thoſe ſouls upon whom the Goſpel hath had its right ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Why is Chriſts honour, the ſouls honour, and Chriſts advancement, the ſouls advancement? And on the contrary, the affliction of the ſoul is Chriſts affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the diſhonour of the ſoul is Chriſts diſhonour? The reaſon is, becauſe the ſoul is brought into uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Lord Chriſt, and where there is ſuch a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48673:19"/>
nearneſs of relation, there will be a nearneſs of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Hence learn the intrinſical, ſpecifical differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the preaching of the Goſpel, and the adminiſtration of the Sacraments of the Goſpel. The preaching of the Goſpel is to draw ſouls into union with Chriſt, but the adminiſtration of the Sacraments of the Goſpel is to manifeſt communion between ſouls and Chriſt already united, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 16. Thence it is that there is a difference to be made between perſons that partake of the Sacraments of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, though not of thoſe that partake of the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel: Every ſoul is a ſutable ſubject to have the Goſpel preached, becauſe every ſoul by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a ſeparated ſoul, and therefore hath need to be brought into union with Chriſt: but onely ſome few ſouls that are ſutable ſubjects, may partake of the Sacraments of the Goſpel, becauſe they are thoſe that do manifeſt a ſoul to have communion, therefore they preſuppoſe union.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> II. The ſecond Uſe is a word of admonition. Seeing the purpoſe of God in revealing Goſpel truths, is to gather ſouls into union with the Lord Chriſt, let this warn every ſoul from heaven, to take heed how he hears the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. It is a good cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the holy Ghoſt gives, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Keep thy foot, when thou goeſt to the houſe of God:</hi> He means, take heed and watch over the affections, intents, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of your ſouls, when you approach near to God in any duty of his worſhip; Then beware your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections ſwerve not from God. There are three great miſcarriages in coming to Goſpel Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A careleſneſs, and mindleſneſs, of the nature,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48673:19"/>
end, and effect of the ordinances of God in approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them. It may be ſaid of moſt ſouls in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, as of thoſe <hi>Acts</hi> 19.32. <hi>In that great aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, the moſt part knew not wherefore they were come together.</hi> Conſider of two things in this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed miſcarriage of heart in attending upon the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Firſt, this heedleſs frame of ſpirit is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God himſelf. When the great God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, ſends a precious Embaſſage to thy poor loveleſs ſoul, and cries to thee, come and be one with me in a Mediator, and thou ſit careleſly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther minding nor regarding the nature of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage, how is it poſſible for thee to caſt higher contempt upon God? Secondly, it is the higheſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity and affront, that can be offered in that kind to the glorious Majeſty of heaven and earth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond great miſcarriage of heart, is the taking ſatisfaction to the ſoul in attaining other ends by Goſpel Ordinances, beneath or without union with the Lord Chriſt. As when the ſoul aims at no higher ends then ſorrow for ſin, or ſome reformation of life, or drawing the heart to the performance of ſome duties of worſhip, as private prayer, reading, or the like; then the heart walks contrary to God in Goſpel Ordinances. Here are two things to be conſidered. Firſt, while thy ſoul ſatisfies it ſelf in any of theſe, thou doſt remain a diſobedient one to the Goſpel of Chriſt. Let thy ſorrow for ſin be what it will, let thy reformation be outward, and inward as thou conceiveſt, the prayers thou performeſt be what they will, ſo long as thou takeſt contentment, without beholding the union compleated between Chriſt and thy ſoul, thou art ſtill a diſobedient one to the Goſpel of Chriſt: There is not the leaſt dram
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48673:20"/>
of ſpiritual obedience in all thoſe duties, but the great command being neglected, thou art a rebel ſtill to the Crown of heaven. Secondly, Thou art a ſtranger to all true Goſpel worſhip, <hi>Without me ye can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, John</hi> 15.5. <hi>Without me,</hi> That is, while your ſouls are disjoyned from me; It is not only meant, without my aid, but without an union with me. Thou art as far from right praying, and hearing in a manner as ever, while thou art void of this union.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third miſcarriage is in the order of the workings of the affections towards God in Goſpel Ordinances. That is, the fixing the intentions of the ſoul upon obtaining any other ends through Goſpel Ordinances, before obtaining union with the Lord Chriſt. The ſoul once ſenſible of the want of union with Chriſt, beholding his State a divided eſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and his Soul, many times longs after an union, but propounds to himſelf a diſorderly way of obtaining it; he propounds the gaining of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and holy qualifications, as the means to attain this union with Jeſus Chriſt. Saith the Soul, while I remain thus, it is impoſſible to gain union; Is it poſſible ſuch a filthy heart, while it remains thus, ſhould be united to the Lord Chriſt? Now here I meet with a queſtion that will be propounded by the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Is union with Chriſt, the firſt intent of God in revealing Goſpel truths? Does not the Lord require, there ſhould firſt be a mortifying of corruption, a drawing the heart from Sin, that there ſhould be a cutting off from the old ſtock, that it might be ingraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the new vine, Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In anſwering this, there are two things firſt to be premiſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:48673:20"/>
                  <hi>Premiſe</hi> 1. Firſt I muſt premiſe this, That the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will of God, is the onely proper object of the ſouls faith. So that we are not to enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Lord may have any ſecret intent in his own boſom ſometimes to lay a ſoul exceeding low, and rent and tear the heart with ſorrow firſt, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to uſe theſe terrours in the ſoul, inſtrumental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to draw it into union.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Premiſe</hi> 2. Secondly, I muſt premiſe, That I ſpeak only of the proper union of the Soul with Chriſt, when we ask whether it be the firſt effect the Lord intends the Goſpel ſhould have upon the heart. Now theſe two things premiſed, I ſhall anſwer the queſtion affirmatively, That the firſt effect that God intends the Goſpel ſhould have upon the heart, is the union of the Soul with Jeſus Chriſt. The Lord intends that, before he intends the drawing of the ſoul from any ſin, before he intends the drawing it to any holineſs, before he intends ſo much as to draw it to prayer. There is nothing to be imagined, that the Lord intends to be wrought in the heart by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt, before the union of the Soul with Chriſt; and that will appear in four particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord propounds the Lord Chriſt to the ſoul lying dead in ſin, immediately to be received. The voice of the Lord is, Thou poor loſt ſoul, that art now dead in ſin, that art utterly loſt, do thou hear, and receive the Son of my boſom the Lord Chriſt, to mediate between thee and me, and to be a <hi>days man</hi> to lay his hand upon us both: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there is now, a diviſion between thee and me, I will be reconciled to thee, and will be thine, and thou ſhalt be mine, We have a notable place in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.6, 8. Saith God, <hi>Thy father was an Amorite, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48673:21"/>
thy mother was an Hittite, and when I paſſed by thee, and ſaw thee polluted in thine own blood, I ſaid unto thee, when thou waſt in thy blood, live; And when I paſſed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold thy time was the time of love,</hi> [not only wherein he propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his love, but ſet his love] <hi>then I entred into a Covenant with thee, ſaith the Lord God, and thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cameſt mine.</hi> If the Lord enter into Covenant with the ſoul, while it lies in its bloud, and as it is in its blood, the Lord receives it into Covenant, then the Covenant of marriage muſt needs be propounded to the ſoul, while it lies thus dead in ſin. I might add <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Even when we were enemies he did reconcile us to himſelf;</hi> There is the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of agreement held forth: There is no middle ſtate, that God calls the ſoul unto, between enmity and amity, but there is an immediate paſſage from enmity into union, into a ſtate of agreement. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. <hi>You hath he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> If Jeſus Chriſt conveyed life into them, when they were dead; then he was propounded to them as life alſo, even while they were dead.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There lies an injunction upon the ſoul at the preſent, to receive the Lord Chriſt into union, while he lies dead in his ſins. This is the command of God, <hi>that ye believe,</hi> that is, that you receive the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus whom he hath ſent, and take him into union with your ſouls; and ſaith he, <hi>this is the work of God.</hi> Now none deny but the command of receiving Chriſt into union, lies upon ſouls dead in ſins for the preſent: And none dare affirm, that God commands the ſoul to walk in diſobedience to his great and higheſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, while he ſhould walk in obedience to an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48673:21"/>
command. Now every moment the ſoul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives not Chriſt into union, it continues in diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Now who can be ſo blockiſh as to conceive, the Lord allow the ſoul to ſtay one moment in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to any command? And if ſo, then the Lord requires that the ſoul ſhould receive Jeſus Chriſt into union, that moment that he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It appears, becauſe there can no ſpiritual act proceed from the ſoul, without union compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Saith Chriſt <hi>John</hi> 15.5. <hi>Without me,</hi> [the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] that is, ſeparate from me ye can do nothing. The leaſt holy ſpiritual motion that can be imagined, cannot be put forth by the ſoul while it remains without union. The dead branches cannot bring forth fruit: ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Every branch that is not in me, withereth.</hi> A dead man cannot walk nor move; neither can a dead ſoul, without union with Jeſus Chriſt, either walk or move in the leaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. So that there cannot be the leaſt ſtep ſet from one corruption, while the ſoul remains without uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I deny not but the Lord may cauſe the branches of ſin to be cut off, and the acts of ſin to be ſuſpended, through the terrours and horrours of the law, and fear of the wrath of God; but the habit of ſin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains the ſame ſtill, and the enmity works as ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the boſom againſt Jeſus Chriſt as before, though it doth not appear ſo much: Therefore it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible there ſhould be a departing from ſin, till the ſoul be brought into union with Jeſus Chriſt, much leſs that it ſhould be acting any holineſs, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming any ſpiritual duty whatſoever. Now in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Lord requires the ſoul, at the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he receives the Goſpel, to depart from all
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48673:22"/>
iniquity, and requires all ſpiritual duties in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, therefore the Lord requires the means to be performed by the ſoul, to yield obedience to the great command, that is, the receiving Jeſus Chriſt into union.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There are no degrees tending to the perfection of the union of the ſoul with Chriſt, nor nothing that can in its own nature tend in an orderly way to the procuring of that union of the ſoul with Chriſt. I deny not, but the Lord may according to his own pleaſure, uſe and imploy many things, as antecedents going before this union; but after the effecting of all theſe things in the heart, that thou conceiveſt tend in order to union with Jeſus Chriſt, the ſoul is no nearer union than it was before any of theſe things were effected in the heart. The reaſon is plain, there is no medium between union and ſeparation and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction; The neareſt point the ſoul can ſtand at is enmity; Now all that can be effected in the heart, before compleating union, takes not away the enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; The ſoul moralized, or civilized, humbled and brought to prayer, is ſtill an enemy: There is but <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> and <hi>ad quem,</hi> the term from which and the term to which, without any medium, or middle State: Nay there is no degree of the union, but a ſoul paſſeth from a State of enmity to perfect union in one inſtant, in one moment: That ſoul that this moment, was an enemy, at an infinite diſtance from God; the next moment, the Lord coming in by an inevitable light into the underſtanding, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable power into the will, is as compleatly uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt as any ſoul in heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:48673:22"/>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> III. The third uſe is by way of examination, to ſee if the precious Goſpel truths have had their effects upon our hearts: And to this end ſearch into your hearts to ſee whether you be united to Jeſus Chriſt. Either you are united to Chriſt, or you are not united; Either you are ſinking in the depths of ſin, or you are upon the rock Chriſt, and all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the knowing of this. Conſider theſe three of four things.</p>
               <p n="1">I. What a curſed ſtupidity and blockiſhneſs 'tis, not to know whether Jeſus Chriſt be united to thee, or at a diſtance from thee. Would we not think that man a block, that knows not whether he be alive or dead?</p>
               <p n="2">II. Conſider how curſedly thou doſt deſpiſe the Lord Chriſt. Wilt thou ride an hundred miles to make ſure of an earthly eſtate, and ſhall the great treaſure of heaven ſtand open to thee, and either 'tis thine, or 'tis not thine, and thou knoweſt not?</p>
               <p n="3">III. Conſider how wretchedly thy ſoul deſtroys the vertue of all Goſpel Ordinances, by diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſearch. While thy ſoul perſeveres care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, not regarding nor examining whether Jeſus Chriſt be one with thee; impoſſible it is that any of the moſt powerful Goſpel Ordinances, ſhould ever convey the leaſt benefit into thy Soul; And that in two reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that thou makeſt thy ſelf an unſutable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for every Goſpel Ordinance. Ordinances have but two ends, either to allure thy ſoul into union, or elſe to ſeal that union, and let thy ſoul enjoy that bleſſed fruit thereof. Now whilſt thou never mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt whether Chriſt be one with thee or no, thou art unſutable for every Ordinance of that kind.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:48673:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. Thou preventeſt the efficacy of every Goſpel Ordinance upon thy ſoul. What concernment is it of to thy ſoul, when the moſt precious arguments of love are ſet forth, by the mouth of a meſſenger of God, when thou mindeſt it not? Firſt, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents the efficacy of all Goſpel Ordinances, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard there can be no ſenſe of the want of union, while thy ſoul neglects the ſearch. Till the prodigal came to conſider he was from his fathers houſe, where there was bread enough; he had no deſire to return, but was content to feed upon husks. Secondly, there can be no ſenſe of the Lords chooſing thy ſoul into union. Though the ſenſe of the want of union, be of abſolute neceſſity to every ſoul, before Goſpel Ordinances take effect, yet this is not ſufficient; ſome think there muſt be a ſenſe of the Lords chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſoul, before the ſoul can cloſe in union with Chriſt, and till then there can never be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the will. Now how can there be a ſenſe of the Lords chooſing thee into union, when thou mindeſt not whether thou beeſt already united to Chriſt or no?</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Conſider how wrongfully thou uſurpeſt the name of a Chriſtian to thy ſelf, when thou regardeſt not whether union between Chriſt and thy Soul be made up. The name of a Chriſtian at leaſt preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth an union of peace, then it preſuppoſeth a time when it was made up; and if ſuch an union be not made up, thou doſt wrongfully uſurp that holy name to thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>But here may be a Queſtion propounded by the Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:48673:23"/>Queſt. <hi>How ſhall I know, whether I be united to Chriſt or no? Or what is it that may evidence the ſouls union?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall firſt premiſe two or three things, and then give an anſwer to the queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Premiſe</hi> 1. Firſt I ſhall premiſe, That the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the Lord Chriſt and the Soul, may be inviſible to the Soul it ſelf. Though the marriage knot may be knit, yet the ſoul may not be able to diſcern it. The rational ſoul is united to the body of a poor infant in the womb, while it is a poor Embrio, yet the rational ſoul knows it not, through the weakneſs of the organs by which it ſhould work: Thus it may be with the ſoul: It may be begotten to the Lord Chriſt by his ſpirit, and yet the ſoul being but a babe in Chriſt, through the imperfection of knowledge, may not be able to diſcern himſelf united to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Premiſe</hi> 2. Secondly I muſt premiſe, That there may be a true and real union, between Chriſt and the ſoul, and yet the ſoul may diſcern many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, and ſad miſcarriages in it ſelf, when the union was effected or produced in that ſoul. The Apoſtles themſelves, at their firſt embracing of Chriſt, had ſtrange conceits of a temporal kingdom of Chriſt, and yet no queſtion the union between Chriſt and their ſouls was real, only through want of clearneſs of light, many diſorderly affections were in them, which were ſet in order after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Premiſe</hi> 3. Thirdly I muſt premiſe alſo, That there is a vaſt difference to be obſerved between ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, or confirming ſigns of union with Chriſt, and evidences of union with Chriſt. Thoſe proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48673:24"/>
are called evidences, that do in their proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture diſcover union whenever they are preſent; So that when ſuch things are preſent, the ſoul cannot queſtion his union with Chriſt. And thoſe cannot properly be called evidences, that are not able to clear up union with Chriſt, whenever they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the ſoul: Now of that nature are many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſitions, and holy qualities in the ſoul, that may be preſent in the ſoul, and not able to clear up the ſouls union; yet theſe are evidences, that may and do clear unqueſtionably, whenever the Lord diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers them. The Queſtion you ask is a great queſtion; The queſtion is, how we ſhall know our union with Chriſt? That is, how we may attain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of union, our union either being dark or doubtful, or elſe never had clear evidences? You that have it, do not ask how you ſhall have it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed more and more, but how you ſhall have evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of your union. Now I ſhall anſwer, Firſt, Negatively, how you may not. Secondly, Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively, how you may.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neg.</hi> Firſt, negatively, how you may not, in three or four things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Firſt, the ſouls union with Chriſt cannot be evidenced from any work of the ſpirit of God, that is effected in, or upon the ſoul. That is neither by his Illumination, Humiliation, or Reformation. Neither by a reſtraining work from ſin, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting work of ſin, or alluring work from ſin, that the ſpirit of God hath effected upon the ſoul. All theſe works are too weak to clear up union to the ſoul, and that upon three grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:48673:24"/>1. In regard all the works of the Spirit upon the Soul that do go before Union, may be, and are wrought upon Souls that never obtain Union with the Lord Chriſt. As Humiliation, ſorrow for Sin, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint from Sin, ſome kind of turning the Heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from Sin, ſome kind of love to the Ordinances of God; All thoſe that go before the very inſtant wherein the Soul is United to Chriſt, may be effected in many Souls that never obtain Union. Nay they may be, and appear greater, in many Souls that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obtained Union, than in Souls that attain unto Union with Chriſt. And in regard thoſe works of the Spirit upon Souls, are common to Souls that are not United, as well as to Souls United, thence they are no Evidences of a Souls Union. Whatever muſt evidence Union to a Soul, muſt be proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Souls United, that it may be properly ſaid, that no Souls that are not compleatly United to Chriſt, can have ſuch a work upon their Hearts. Now no ſuch work goes before immediate union, but may be common to a Soul never United to Chriſt. For Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of Sin, and Sorrow for Sin, I might inſtance in <hi>Judas.</hi> In reformation and deſire to Ordinances, we need go no further than a Wretched <hi>Herod,</hi> Mark 6.20. <hi>He heard John Baptiſt gladly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed many things.</hi> For a Souls Mourning after God apparently, we may ſee it in <hi>Eſau:</hi> A Soul out of the ſenſe of want of Union may Mourn moſt bitterly: Now in regard of rhe Commonality of the works to Souls not United, as well as unto Souls Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they can be no Evidences of Union.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard theſe works of the Spirit upon the Soul, can yield no Divine Witneſs, or Teſtimony un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the poor doubting Soul. Indeed all the works of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48673:25"/>
God Originally are Divine Works, and Works of Divine Power, yet they have no Power to yield a Divine Teſtimony: Now nothing can be a ſufficient ground for the Soul to believe its Union with Chriſt, unleſs it be a Divine ground. The proper object of all Divine Faith muſt be a Divine ground: If it be a Fallible Ground, it is a Fallible Faith; if an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Ground, it is an uncertain Faith; if a Humane Ground, it is a Humane Faith. Now in caſe upon thoſe grounds (as the ſight of ſuch works of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God) the Soul ſhould believe its Union with Chriſt, it ſhould not believe it with a Divine Faith, becauſe there is no Divine ground to believe it upon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard there is no promiſe of Union with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, made by God unto Souls that have theſe works of the Spirit of God upon them: That is, no promiſe to the Soul that is Burdened with Sin or the like; I mean thus, the Lord doth not engage in any of theſe promiſes, to Souls that had ſuch and ſuch Works of the Spirit of God upon them, that thoſe he would bring into Union, and none but thoſe; That is, becauſe my Soul is burdened with Sin, or becauſe the Spirit of God hath now convinced my Soul, in this or that manner, that therefore I have right to ſuch and ſuch a promiſe. No, theſe Promiſes are made to Souls in reference to Union with Chriſt, that by Union with Jeſus Chriſt, I might have right to theſe Promiſes, and to the effecting thoſe Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications in the Soul too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 2. Secondly we cannot evidence our Union, by any thing inherent in the Soul: That is, not by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gracious Quality, Habit, Inclination, or Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that is infuſed from God into the Soul. The
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48673:25"/>
Graces of the Spirit Communicated to the Soul, and dwelling in it, are as inſufficient to manifeſt and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence this intereſt in Chriſt, as the workings of the Spirit upon the Soul, I mean all holy Diſpoſitions, and Inclinations that are Communicated to any Soul. And that upon theſe grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In regard of the neer ſimilitude and likeneſs of Counterfeit Qualities, and Graces, to all thoſe Holy Qualities, and Graces, and Habits that can be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in a Soul. The Devil hath his Artiſts at work, as well as the Spirit of God is at work; and there is no precious Jewel of Grace the Spirit frames in the Soul, but the Devils Artiſts can Counterſeit a Jewel of as neer Similitude as poſſible, only to delude poor Souls: Yea there is ſuch a neerneſs of likeneſs in thoſe falſe Diſpoſitions, to thoſe True Precious Holy Qualities, as the imperfect ſight of the Soul cannot poſſibly diſcern the difference, when the Union of the Soul is dark. As to inſtance in Poverty of Spirit, which is an emptineſs of the Soul of all Confidence in it ſelf, being nothing in its own eyes: Mark what a neer Counterfeit the Devils Artiſts can make cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Pride of Spirit, ſo as it can ſcarce be diſcerned, nay ſo neer, as the Soul commonly miſtakes. A Soul is convinced of Sin, and moved to accept of the Lord Chriſt tendred: Now comes the Devil; What ſuch a Curſed Wretch as thou art receive the Lord Chriſt tendred? The Lord Chriſt is of Holy, Pure, Unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed eyes, <hi>purer than to behold Iniquity;</hi> Canſt think the Lord will accept of ſuch a forlorn Soul as thine, that hath ſo curſedly Rebelled againſt him? O no, ſaith the Soul, I dare not conceive God will look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, who am ſuch a Curſed Wretch: Alas poor Soul, thou thinkeſt this to be Poverty of Spirit, when
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48673:26"/>
indeed it is Curſed Pride: Thou wouldeſt have ſome ground of Confidence in thy ſelf, that the Lord ſhould accept of thee, and thou thinkeſt it great Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility in thy ſelf, like another <hi>Peter, what Jeſus Chriſt Waſh my Feet?</hi> Now what neer likeneſs is here between this Pride of Spirit, and Poverty of Spirit? All the difference is here, that the Soul that is truly poor, deſires never to have any thing in himſelf to reſt upon; The Soul hath no hope of ever having any thing as it is in itſelf, and alas this difference is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerned. Thus alſo if you go to Sincerity of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: Saith the Soul, though I do fail in my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, yet I hope my Heart is ſincere towards God in all that I do, and that is given as another evidence of the Souls Union. I ſay it is true, but the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, how we ſhall diſcern it from the meer working of Ignorance? Sincerity is a ſingle eye to the Will of God, and to his Honour and Glory in what thou doſt; but according to the Souls Judgment, a Soul acted meerly by the principle of Ignorance, may have a ſingle eye at Gods Glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2, 3. The <hi>Jews</hi> had <hi>a Zeal for God, but not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;</hi> and ſo they went about <hi>to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs:</hi> Hence the Soul will ſay I think I have Sincerity of heart, but I do not certainly know, I may be deceived. Thus in theſe chief things there is ſuch a neerneſs, that we can ſcarce diſcern the Jewel from the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit.</p>
               <p n="2">II. In regard thoſe holy Diſpoſitions, Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Habits of Grace, do properly proceed from ſome kind of evidence of a Souls Union, and according to the clearneſs of the Souls evidence of Union, ſo do theſe Graces increaſe, and according
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48673:26"/>
as the Souls. Union is eclipſed, ſo do they decreaſe. To begin with that, which moſt promiſes ſeem to be made to, that is to <hi>Mourners.</hi> Whence does true Mourning for Sin in the Soul proceed? Is it not from a ſight of the Lord Chriſt? Yea, from ſome ſight of the Souls propriety in Chriſt, at leaſt thus far, from ſome ſight of probable intereſt in Chriſt. Is it not from thence the Soul beholds firſt the curſed nature of Sin? Indeed the horridneſs of the nature of Sin never appears, but in the precious glaſs of the Lords Bowels of Mercy to poor Loveleſs Souls.</p>
               <p n="3">III. In regard the right nature and truth of thoſe Holy Qualities, or Habits of Grace in the Soul, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſcerned but from the ſight of the Union of the Soul with Chriſt. And that in theſe reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard there is not a full conformity in thoſe Holy Qualities inherent in thy Heart, to the rule of the Word that doth command thoſe Holy Qualities. Should I begin at the loweſt, which is Sincerity of heart in the Souls Obedience unto God: The Soul can ſeldom (I might ſay never) ſee a Conformity in his Obedience to the rule of the word; The rule is in <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.5, 6. (it is ſpoken concerning Servants, but it holdeth in every duty.) <hi>Servants be Obedient to them that are your Maſters according to the Fleſh, with fear and Trembling, in ſingleneſs of your Heart as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, not with eye-Service as men-pleaſers, but as the Servants of Chriſt, doing the Will of God from the Heart.</hi> True Sincerity in Obedience to any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, it is a ſingleneſs of Heart unto Jeſus Chriſt; a ſingle eye, that is, having reſpect to nothing but Chriſt alone; The <hi>ſpecies</hi> of all the viſion of that eye with which he reſpects the duty, being taken from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt alone. Now how far ſhort ſhall a Soul
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48673:27"/>
ſee it ſelf of a conformity to the rule? When can the ſoul ſay his heart was ſingle to Chriſt in prayer, or in any Ordinance? Now in regard the ſoul may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold at all times, ſo great a difference in the holy qualities inherent in his heart, to the rule that it ought to be brought to a full conformity to; thoſe holy qualities in the heart cannot evidence unto the ſoul the truth of its union with Chriſt. The truth of them cannot appear in themſelves without a ſight of the ſouls union, in regard of the imperfection of the ſouls ſight, to diſcern the depths of his own heart. Any knowing ſoul judgeth it ſelf to be far unable to ſearch the depths of his own heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17, 9. <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who can know it?</hi> Thence it is, the ſoul hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſufficient evidence of the truth of any holy quality in himſelf, from the quality it ſelf, to anſwer all the objections of a carnal heart, becauſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains unanſwered, <hi>the heart is deceitful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard the truth of thoſe holy qualities ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear only as they do proceed from faith. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unleſs the ſoul diſcerns, and knows them to be fruits of faith, it cannot conclude them to be holy qualities, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God;</hi> Now he that diſcerns faith, diſcerns union with Chriſt, therefore it muſt needs be, that there is a ſight of union, before a ſight of the truth of thoſe holy qualities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. The third negative anſwer is this, That the union of the ſoul with Chriſt, cannot be eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by any thing done, or effected by the ſoul, or that can be effected and done. Whether we look upon works internal, or works external; whether we look upon the inward moving of the affections to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48673:27"/>
to God, or whether we look upon the expreſſions of thoſe affections, that is, the breaking out of thoſe affections into prayer, and conſtant interceſſions with God, into reading, and hearing, and attending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ordinances, into holineſs expreſſed in the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, by none of theſe can the union with Jeſus Chriſt be cleared and evidenced. Yet for the right underſtanding of this, theſe three things are to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I do not mean, that no work of the ſoul, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inward or outward, done by the ſoul, is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the ſouls union with Chriſt. Though no work of the ſoul be able to clear the union, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it, yet the work may be an evidence in it ſelf. The inward act of Faith is an infallible evidence of the ſouls union, where the ſoul is able to underſtand that act of Faith, to be of the right nature the word of God requires Faith to be in the Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I do not mean neither in this concluſion, that the union of the ſoul with Chriſt may be evidenced, without the ſouls beholding any work, either inward or outward in it ſelf. For infallibly, and neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the ſouls beholding its union with the Lord Chriſt, it does behold ſome workings in its ſpirit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, ſome holy act in, and upon Jeſus Chriſt; At the ſame time the ſoul beholds its union with Jeſus Chriſt, it beholds its receiving Jeſus Chriſt, which is an act of Faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The meaning of the concluſion is this, That no works, either inward, or outward, performed by the ſoul, have ſufficient light in themſelves, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt themſelves unto the ſoul; nor from themſelves and their own nature, to manifeſt the union of the ſoul with Chriſt. Though there is an inward act of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48673:28"/>
ſoul, that is an inſeparable evidence of the ſouls uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is the act of Faith; yet that act of Faith in it ſelf conſidered, as is is the meer act and work of the ſoul, hath not ſufficient light in it ſelf, to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ſelf to the ſoul, that it is the inſeparable act of the ſouls union: Likewiſe is every work of the ſoul, inward, or outward, of the ſame nature. The works of the ſoul may be works of light, and yet the beams of light ſhine ſo dimly forth, as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcover their own nature to the ſoul; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcover themſelves to be thoſe works that the Scripture holds forth to be the infallible conſequence of the ſouls union with Chriſt. And that the works of the ſoul have not ſufficient light in themſelves to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover union, will appear in divers reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe all the works of the ſoul united to Chriſt, may be preſent in the ſoul, when the union of the ſoul with Chriſt is obſcure and dark. The act of Faith, that is the moſt eminent effect of the ſouls union with Chriſt, may be very ſtrong in the ſoul, when the ſoul may be yet dark. A clear inſtance will be given in <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.46. by the Captain of our Salvation, who believed when he hung upon the Croſs, and exerciſed Faith in God, as appears in thoſe words, <hi>My God;</hi> yet the union between Jeſus Chriſt and God the Father, as Mediator, was dark, that made him cry out, <hi>My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> The hypoſtatical union was firm, and as firm as now it is in heaven, but the manifeſtation of that union was obſcure, when the Lord Chriſt did bear the greateſt burden of the conſequence of ſin, that was poſſible, in bearing the ſenſe of the abſence of God from him for a ſeaſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It appears in regard the union between Chriſt
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48673:28"/>
and the ſoul is only paſſive. The union is compleat between Jeſus Chriſt and the ſoul, before any one act goes forth from the ſoul unto Chriſt. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible there ſhould be the leaſt motion of the ſoul towards the perfecting, or compleating of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between Chriſt and the ſoul, unleſs we could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there may be motions in dead perſons, that there may be action where there is no life. Now the union being paſſive, there may be a manifeſtation of the union, between Jeſus Chriſt and the ſoul at the ſame time, at the ſame moment that the union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and the ſoul is compleated: I do not ſay it is ordinary, but I ſay there may be a ſight of the Lord Chriſt, coming down into the heart, in that inſtant, and moment, wherein Jeſus Chriſt does take actual poſſeſſion of the heart, and unite it unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Now in caſe the union of the ſoul ſhould be ſo evidenced with Chriſt, then ſhould all works, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inward or outward in the ſoul, be excluded from having any intereſt in the manifeſtation of that union.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard the ſame kind of works that do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe properly from the union of the ſoul with Chriſt, (though not peculiarly) may ariſe from other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples where there is no union. There are three falſe originals of ſuch outward works.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) God himſelf may be the Original of ſuch works in ſome ſouls, though not by vertue of union, nor in relation unto union. That is, though the Lord convey not any influences, that are the proper influences peculiar unto union, nor though the Lord does not convey thoſe influences into the ſoul, from whence thoſe outward works proceed to bring the ſoul into union with Jeſus Chriſt. Prayer and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48673:29"/>
the truths of God, and reading of them, and all outward works of a ſoul, may be produced by God in the ſoul, only in relation to other ſouls that are already united to himſelf.</p>
               <p>The Lord may convey large ſtreams of gifts, and inward affections unto ſome ſouls, and excite them to the imploying of all thoſe gifts, in all outward works of his own worſhip, only in reſpect to the good of his own peoples ſouls, when the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not any benefit to the ſoul that partakes of thoſe gifts. Thus the Lord dealt with <hi>Cyrus, Iſa.</hi> 45.1. and Chap. 44.28. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord to</hi> Cyrus, <hi>he is my ſhepherd, and ſhall perform all my pleaſure, even ſaying to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>thou ſhalt be built, and to the Temple, thy foundation ſhall he laid.</hi> The Lord did convey ſtrength to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to carry him on in a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious work of reforming his worſhip, and to build the Temple, when the Lord intended no good to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I mean ſo as to bring his ſoul into union with Chriſt. Thus God furniſhed <hi>John</hi> with Zeal againſt Idolatry, for the good of his peoples ſouls, and it redounded little to the good of his ſoul. For ought we know, <hi>Judas</hi> was furniſhed with as good gifts as the reſt of the Apoſtles, and ſeemed to pray with as much earneſtneſs, and publiſh the truths of Chriſt with as much Zeal as any of the Apoſtles; whereas none of thoſe gifts that <hi>Judas</hi> had, were conveyed by vertue of the union of his ſoul with Chriſt, nor were given with an intent to bring his ſoul into union.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) A ſecond falſe original of ſuch works is the ſouls own principle of ſelf. Self ends, ſelf luſts, ſelf intendments, may be like the ſpring that may ſet all the wheels of the affections on work, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all thoſe outward expreſſions in the work of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48673:29"/>
God. Certainly it was one of the chief intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Phariſees, in all their works of holineſs, and ſtrictneſs in their converſation, that they might advance themſelves outwardly, and to eternity, and thought to tie God to give them heaven for it.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) The third falſe original of works that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly flow from union, is from the Devil himſelf. The workings of prayer, of hearing, of meditating, or forſaking ſin in the converſation, may come from the Devil himſelf, he taking his opportunity to ſail with the wind, and row with the tide; He ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Affections work towards duties of holineſs, he preſſes with all his might to the performance of them, that he might weary out the ſoul with them, or elſe cauſe the confidence of the ſoul to be placed in them, and the ſoul to promiſe it ſelf happineſs by them. Certainly the Zeal of <hi>Paul</hi> that he had for God, and the law of God, was acted by the Devil himſelf. And <hi>Saul</hi> that was ſo Zealous to offer ſacrifice before he went to battle, it was from the Devil. Thoſe ſouls that are preſſed ſo violently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prayer, as they will neglect their callings to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply duties of prayer; I queſtion not, though ſuch excitations come from conſcience to urge them, yet they are originally from the Devil himſelf; And certainly many a ſoul hath found the ſad effect of the Devil in it, in cauſing the ſoul to be weary of all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to caſt them off. Now in regard the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the ſouls works that it performs, is thus queſtionable, whether they have their original from the ſouls union with Chriſt, or from one of theſe falſe principles; Thence theſe works are not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in themſelves, to manifeſt the ſouls union with Chriſt. The queſtion muſt firſt be anſwered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48673:30"/>
theſe duties flow from union with Chriſt or no? before the other queſtion can be anſwered, whether thoſe works be the proper effects of union? And till that queſtion be anſwered, the ſoul can never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from his works, that he is united to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nothing that is done by the ſoul can manifeſt the ſouls union, in regard the union of the ſoul with Chriſt cannot be concluded from works, as a neceſſary truth, grounded upon an unchangeable, and infallible reaſon. That is the great diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween opinion and knowledge; That knowledg is the apprehenſion of a truth, flowing neceſſarily from an unchangable ground, whereas opinion flowes onely from a probable ground. Now the works of the ſoul can never be an unchangeable ground, from whence the ſoul can conclude himſelf to be united to Chriſt in three regards.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) In regard no work ſimply conſidered in it ſelf, without reſpect to its original, can be concluded to be a fruit or conſequence of the ſouls union. The ſame kind of work may be performed from a falſe original, as well by vertue of influences from the Devil into our hearts, as from God; Therefore till it diſcern that the original is from Chriſt, that it was by the very motion, and ſtirring of Chriſt in the heart, that the work was done, the ſoul cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it to be a conſequence of his union; Now ſo long as the work cannot appear to be a conſequence of the ſouls union, there can be no infallible ground to conclude that he is united to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) In regard no works can manifeſt union, but ſuch as are the peculiar and inſeperable effects of the ſouls union with Chriſt. Now no ſoul can diſcern his
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48673:30"/>
works to be the peculiar inſeperable effect of union, unleſs he can diſcern and conclude his ſoul ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and perſevere to the end in thoſe works: But now no Soul can diſcern, or conclude from any thing, but from a promiſe of the God of truth which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unchangable, that he ſhall perſevere in any Holy work whatever; and no Soul can lay claim to any promiſe, till he can claim right to Union with Jeſus Chriſt, therefore no Soul can ſee his perſeverance in any ſuch work, till he ſee his Union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard the Judgment that the Soul paſſeth upon thoſe works, is a deceivable Judgment. The heart being a bottomleſs depth that is unſearchable, the nature of all his works cannot be diſcerned by the weak capacity of the Soul; thence the Soul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not draw that concluſion from them, as a certain conſequence of his Union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 4. Neither can the Union of the Soul with Chriſt be thus evidenced, from the outward Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the nature and manner, of the Union of the Soul with Chriſt. I do not mean, that the Union of the Soul with Chriſt, may not be evidenced by the revelation of the nature and manner of the Union of the Soul with Chriſt: The Lord Chriſt doth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily through thoſe Revelations of his truth, cauſe the impreſſion of truth to remain upon Spirits; The Lord by revealing to Souls, a Union to be attained by Chriſt, ordinarily draws Souls into Union, and by declaring the nature and manner of the Union, doth ordinarily diſcover to Souls thus their Union with Chriſt: Yet the nature and manner of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Union, conſidered in themſelves, is not enough barely conſidered in themſelves to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the Union. And that will appear in three things.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:48673:31"/>I. Becauſe thoſe outward Revelations reach no higher than Reaſons eye. Now while the light of Truth pierce no farther than the eye of Reaſon, the right Conſequences of it, are never effected in the Soul. That's the reaſon that the revelation of the ſweeteſt perſwaſions of God to allure Souls into Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, take no effect upon the Heart of knowing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, becauſe thoſe outward Revelations reach but to Reaſons eye; and therefore they muſt hear and learn of the Father before they come to Chriſt. <hi>John</hi> 6.45. In the ſame manner is the Revelation of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Souls United, as inſufficient to ſatisfy the Soul concerning his Union, as thoſe other Revelations of the Lords will to draw Souls into Union.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard the truth to be apprehended, which is the Souls particular Union with Chriſt, is far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Reaſons Comprehenſion. Now while the light reacheth no higher than to Reaſons eye, Reaſon not being able to comprehend the truth, needs muſt the truth be inefficacious.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All the Wranglings and Objections of the Soul againſt his Union, remain in full Power, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thoſe Revelations to the eye of Reaſon. Till a higher light be ſet up in the Soul, to be Lord Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troler as it were of Reaſon, the Soul is never able to believe, that is, to receive Chriſt into Union.</p>
               <p n="2">II. In regard thoſe communicate no light to the eye, to which thoſe truths are propounded. As it is at firſt in the Lords Conviction of a Soul by the truth, the outward revealing of it is inſufficient, in regard there is no light by thoſe revealings to convey it to the Souls eye; for though the truth be made clear and apparent, the eye is ſtill blind, therefore the Soul is not Convinced: So it is in revealing to the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48673:31"/>
Soul its Union, the Revelation is inſufficient, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard there is no beam of light comes to the Souls eye: And though the eye of the Soul have received light from Heaven, yet the light to diſcern the Souls Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, muſt be a new light.</p>
               <p n="3">III. In regard United Souls that fully underſtand both the nature and manner of Union, may be, and are frequently yet unſatisfied about their Union. Queſtionleſs poor <hi>Heman</hi> (in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.) knew well what it was to be accepted of God in Chriſt, and to be one with him, and yet was far from apprehending himſelf to be United, but gave up himſelf for a dead man. <hi>David</hi> when he made that 22 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> typical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaking of Chriſt (though applying it to his own condition) knew well enough what it was to have the Lord to be his, and did hang upon him; yet he cried out, fearing God had forſaken him. Now if the outward Revelation of the nature, and manner of the Souls Union with Chriſt, were enough to make the Soul underſtand its Union; then there were no united Soul, that did hear the relation of it, and did carefully reflect upon his own heart, but muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied about his union; but our experience tells us this, that the moſt underſtanding Souls about union, are hardeſt to be ſatisfied about their union. Thus you have the negative part of the anſwer opened. Now before I proceed to the affirmative, there is another queſtion will be caſt in upon the neck of this.</p>
               <p>Que. 1. <hi>But may the Soul ſay, If none of theſe can evidence to the Soul his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt, are all thoſe Souls evidences of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion that they have received, from ſomething thus inherent in themſelves, and done upon them by the Spirit of God, rotten and unſound, and no evidences? Muſt we now caſt away all our thoughts
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48673:32"/>
of union with Jeſus Chriſt, that were formerly gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ſight of ſuch qualifications inherent in our ſouls?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I come to anſwer this queſtion, I muſt firſt premiſe two or three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the ſoul hath not conceived either quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties inherent in his ſoul, or works done by his ſoul, as the cauſe of his union with God in Chriſt. That theſe ſhould be the uniting means between Chriſt and thy ſoul, that have drawn the Lord Chriſt to come into thy heart, and to dwel in thee, and ſo to cauſe thee to dwell in him. This were no leſs than groſs Popery, to make any thing in our ſelves the cauſe of union.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I alſo premiſe, That thou haſt not taken quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties inherent in thy ſelf, or works done by thy ſelf, as the ground upon which thou didſt believe thy union with Chriſt. This were a very dangerous ſandy foundation for a ſoul to build upon: This were to ground a divine faith upon an humane ground, to ground a certain concluſion upon a poor changeable ground; And this were to make thy faith of no longer laſting, than the conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of thine heart in ſuch works, or the conſtancy of thy ſight in beholding ſuch diſpoſitions in thy heart; This is both unſafe, and exceeding dangerous.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I muſt premiſe, That thou miſtakeſt not the ground of thy evidence, conceiving thy ſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thy evidence from qualities inherent in thy ſelf, or works done by thy ſelf, when thou receiveſt it from a promiſe of free grace alone. It may be at the ſame time, when the Lord declared to thee his willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to accept of thy ſoul into union with Chriſt, and let thee ſee thine heart cloſing with that graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48673:32"/>
tender; he at the ſame time lets thee ſee ſuch holy diſpoſitions in thy ſoul as the conſequence of thy union, thence it may be thou didſt conclude thy evidence was from theſe, when it was from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the firſt place before works.</p>
               <p>But if the queſtion be demanded, whether thy qualifications thus conſidered be evidences?</p>
               <p>I anſwer negatively, and affirmatively.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they are no right kind of evidences.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are no evidences of Faith. That which is an evidence unto the eye of Faith, muſt be ſome truth of God revealed unto faith, with ſuch an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that for the authority of the ſpeaker, and revealer of that truth, the ſoul doth believe it, and cloſe with it. Now in that manner, the word alone is proper evidence unto faith. Aſſurance of faith muſt always have a divine ground, to build upon: Now there is no divine ground, but a divine word; and thine own diſpoſitions and graces are no divine, but a humane ground.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are no evidence of knowledge. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is the aſſent of the underſtanding to a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary truth, built upon an unchangeable ground or reaſon. Now the union of thy ſoul with Chriſt could never be rightly taken as a neceſſary truth, built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thine own works, as the unchangable reaſon of it; For (as you have heard) no works done by the ſoul can be an unchangeable reaſon upon which a ſoul may build ſuch a truth as this, that he is united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, in regard thou wert never yet fully cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the right nature of thoſe thy works, or of thoſe diſpoſitions in thy ſoul, from whence thou didſt gather thoſe thoughts of thy union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:48673:33"/>Secondly, I anſwer affirmatively, they may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly called evidences, and they may have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten an evidence of opinion in thy ſoul, though not an evidence of knowledge. Opinion is the aſſent of the underſtanding to ſome truth propounded, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſight of probable grounds and reaſons of the truth of the thing propounded. Now the ſight of thy gracious diſpoſitions and qualifications may be an evidence of opinion to thy ſoul, that is, they may have afforded ſome probable arguments of thy union with Chriſt; And from thence may have flown theſe three effects of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thence may have riſen a quiet and calm in the ſoul, a ceſſation from thoſe perturbations and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, the ſoul was diſquieted with formerly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence might flow ſome refreſhments. A hope of poſſibility to the poor ſinking ſoul brings admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble refreſhment: Much like a man being ready to ſuffer Ship-wrack at Sea, ſeeing but a ſhip coming towards him, gives him hope of being taken in.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From hence may ariſe ſome flitting joy. Though Chriſt do but paſs by as it were, and the ſoul does but ſee his face through a crevis, it refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his heart.</p>
               <p>Thus far they may be evidences of opinion unto ſouls: But there are divers things that muſt be noted about this evidence of opinion leaſt we miſtake. For though I dare not ſay but theſe evidences of opinion in many ſouls, may prove ſuch, that in the utmoſt iſſue of them may hold to eternity, yet it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great danger, to the ſafety and comfort of ſuch ſouls. Therefore obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">I. That theſe evidences of opinion in ſouls, do yet fall ſhort of raiſing thoſe ſouls, into a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48673:33"/>
to the rules of Scripture, about and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning evidences of union. And that will appear in three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard theſe evidences of opinion cannot riſe to that fulneſs of certainty, and that ſtrength of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, that the rules concerning evidences of a ſouls union, do require ſouls to be raiſed to. When this opinion is raiſed to the higheſt degree, there cannot be a full certainty: Now the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſouls to attain a full confidence about their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard the foundation of the ſouls conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in theſe evidences, is laid upon a ground diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rule. The rule is onely the will of God revealed; Now the will of God revealed is, that there ſhould be immutable grounds upon which the ſoul ſhould be built, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard the conſolation of the ſoul, is unſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in meaſure and degree, to that which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for his peoples ſouls. He intends full conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to them, a plerophery of conſolation. But how weak are thoſe comforts, that flow from thoſe weak fluctuating inherent grounds of the ſouls qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, or the working of thoſe qualities?</p>
               <p n="2">II. You muſt note about theſe evidences of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That no ſoul may juſtly ſatisfie or content it ſelf, with only thoſe evidences of opinion. Perfection of conformity to Scripture rule, is the command and injunction that lies upon every ſoul: Now theſe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of opinion being attained, and yet the ſoul falls ſhort of Scripture rules; thence it neceſſarily follows, that no ſoul may, or ought, to content it ſelf with thoſe evidences.</p>
               <p n="3">III. You muſt note, That the ſeeking after, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48673:34"/>
walking by theſe evidences of opinion only, do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſoul to the want of all props, ſupports, and comforts, in the greateſt neceſſities of the ſoul. Theſe evidences are like the little Brook the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſat down by, when he went from <hi>Jeze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> that ran only in the beginning of the famin, and after was dry. Or rather they are like <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Gourd, (<hi>Jonah</hi> 4.6.) of which the poor man was exceeding glad for a night and felt the ſhadow of it, but when the Sun aroſe, a worm ſtruck the Gourd, and <hi>Jonah</hi> was expoſed to the heat of the Sun. Thus may the evidences of the ſoul from inherent qualities, and the working of thoſe qualities, be like a precious Gourd for a ſeaſon, where the ſoul may have refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but if the Sun gets to the mid heavens, and there come any ſcorching heat, then do they vaniſh like <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Gourd, and the ſoul is expoſed to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs, hopeleſs condition for eternity.</p>
               <p>There are four great neceſſities of the ſoul, when it hath the greateſt need of evidences, and in all theſe the evidence of opinion fails the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="1">1 When any Sin in the heinouſneſs of its guilt, and the dreadfulneſs of its merit and deſert, is charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the conſcience. When Sin comes once to be thus charged, it cauſeth all the evidences of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to vaniſh and periſh, and leaves the ſoul comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. As it was with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51.3. he cries out, <hi>My ſin is ever before me:</hi> Or as it was with poor <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 13.26, 27, <hi>Thou writeſt bitter things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, and makeſt me poſſeſs the iniquities of my youth.</hi> Now when the ſoul is either in <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe, or <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, that any iniquity comes thus before the ſoul, then is a ſoul in great neceſſity of union with Chriſt: When a debt comes to be charged upon a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48673:34"/>
perſon, and the Bayliff comes to arreſt him, then there is neceſſity of ſome bayl; now conſcience comes to arreſt the ſoul, and offers to carry it into hell, and now do thoſe evidences of opinion from the ſouls graces, leave the ſoul hopeleſs, and helpleſs: The thing is evident, when conſcience is thus charging an iniquity upon the ſoul, it becomes Witneſs, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, and Judg: It witneſſeth the fact to be done, it pleads the fact condemnation, and pronounceth the ſentence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond great neceſſity is, when ſome ſtrong maſter corruption leads the ſoul captive; and even keeps the poor diſtreſſed ſoul in chains. You muſt know, though the reigning power of ſin be deſtroyed in ſouls united to Chriſt, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14.) yet the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranizing power of ſin is not deſtroyed: Though ſin cannot have the Throne of the will, to ſit there as Lord Commander, yet it will be always ſtriving for the Throne; then is the ſoul in great ſtraights, and knows not what to do without evidence of union with Chriſt, that he knows he ſhall be conqueror over ſuch a corruption: Now in this condition, the inherent qualities of the ſoul, and the works of ſanctification, leave the ſoul helpleſs and comfortleſs; now the eye of the ſoul is upon corruption, and it is hard for him at that time to diſcern grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another great exigency of the ſoul for the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his union, is when the influences of the quickning ſpirit are ſuſpended from the ſoul. When not only a ſtate of deadneſs is grown upon the heart, but as with thoſe <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.4. God ſeems to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with their prayers, and comes not in; That the ſoul begins to complain, as in <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.44, that the Lord ſhuts out his prayers; or complain as
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48673:35"/>
                  <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 23.8, 9. <hi>Behold I go forward, but he is not there, and backward, but I cannot perceive him,</hi> &amp;c. Then is the ſoul in great extremity, that now unleſs there be ſome grounds of evidence of union, the ſoul begins to be hopeleſs, and altogether comfortleſs; And alas when the ſoul is brought to this exigency, then doth its evidence of opinion from its own grace fail, and the ſoul queſtions whether it ever drew a right concluſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth extremity is, When the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers the ſoul to the buffetings of Satan for a ſeaſon. When Satan begins to uſe all his policy to ſhake the foundations of the ſoul, to make his hope and faith to ſhake; when the Devil chargeth his Cannons againſt the ſoul, and letteth looſe all temptations at once; blaſphemous thoughts come into the heart, queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether there be a God or no, and the ſoul can meddle with nothing, but one blaſphemous thought or other comes upon the ſoul, and it knows not from whence they come: And when Satan is thus buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoul, then a mans inherent graces, and the workings of them that he ſaw before, do now fail the ſoul, in regard Satan in this caſe firſt ſtrikes at the ſtrongeſt hold, he ſtrikes at the foundation, he ſtrikes at union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is a fourth note about evidences of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; That the ſouls cleaving unto them, doth make the certainty of the truth of God increaſe and diminiſh, according to the increaſing and diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the workings of his ſoul, and of the influence of the ſpirit of God upon his heart. Experience it ſelf teacheth us, that while our ſouls take our evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences from thoſe qualifications, ſo long as we find the ſpirit of God working lively in our hearts, our
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48673:35"/>
hopes are lively, and our confidence firm; and no ſooner theſe ceaſe again, but our confidence and our hope fail; then the Soul queſtions again whether Jeſus Chriſt be tendred to his Soul in particular? whereas before he had ſome confidence of it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is a fifth note about theſe evidences of opinion, and that is this, That the cleaving unto thoſe evidences of opinion, doth make the whole life and comfort of the ſoul depend only upon ſenſe. When the ſoul truſts to thoſe alone, he truſts only the eye of ſenſe, both in ſeeing his happineſs for the preſent, and for eternity. Now from thence,</p>
               <p>Firſt, The fulneſs of the ſouls conſolation is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. The ſoul, as it were, ſhuts the great win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, which is the evidence of grace in the promiſe unto the ſoul, and only opens the ſmall crevis of ſenſe and experience: Now needs muſt the fulneſs of light in the houſe be prevented, when the greateſt window is ſhut voluntarily; And much more is the comfort of the ſoul prevented, when the great window of comfort is ſhut.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The conſtancy of conſolation is prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The ſoul may both ſee the Lords will to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable towards him, in taking him into union, and may ſee the command of God to his ſoul to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that his union, and receive the promiſe of God to take his ſoul into union, when the ſoul can ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of thoſe precious workings of grace in his own heart: So that the conſtancy of the ſouls conſolation, depends not upon the evidence that he can receive, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the inherent graces in him, or the working of thoſe graces, but upon that which is conſtant in it ſelf, when the heart is unconſtant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:48673:36"/>Thirdly, Thence the ſoul walks contrary to the Scripture rule. The rule is, <hi>to walk by faith,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.7. <hi>and to live by faith rather than by ſight:</hi> But when the ſoul adheres only to, and ſeeks after the evidence of his union from the working of his own graces, the ſoul ſeeks to live and walk only by ſight, and not by faith.</p>
               <p>Now there is a ſecond Queſtion that will ariſe, before I can paſs to the affirmative anſwer.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>If thoſe inherent qualities and habits of grace in ſouls, and the workings of them, cannot thus evidence the ſouls union primarily, nor be no better grounds of evidence than this: Then why do the Scriptures propound the ſouls obedience unto God, and love unto God, as ſigns and evidences of the ſouls uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For the anſwer of this queſtion, there are divers things to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Many of the Scriptures, that the ſoul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives to lay down ſuch graces, and workings of graces, as ſigns of the ſouls union, are onely laid down as manifeſt ſigns of their union with Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, not themſelves. As <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.16, 20. <hi>By their fruit ye ſhall know them:</hi> The place, if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, doth not ſay by your own fruits you ſhall evidence your own condition, but it propounds the converſations of men, to be the rule by which we ſhall judge of men, by which we may conceive their union with Chriſt, or ſeparation from Chriſt, yet this cannot yield an infallible evidence to us of their union.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All other places that ſpeak of the graces of the ſpirit, or of obedience to God to be as ſigns of the ſouls union with Chriſt, do only lay them down
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48673:36"/>
as Co-witneſſing ſigns, not as thoſe from whence the ſoul can firſt clear his union. Thus far indeed the word manifeſts, that there are ſuch graces in the hearts of believers, and that believers do ſee ſuch graces in their hearts; But it is then that believers do ſee them, when they ſee their union with Chriſt. No believer ever had a true evidence of his union with Chriſt, but he alſo ſaw ſome ſuch precious holy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions begotten in his ſoul, and ſome workings of them alſo towards Chriſt. So that the Scripture lays them down as Co-witneſſes. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>The ſpirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our ſpirits, that we are the Sons of God:</hi> That is, the light of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed underſtanding, beholding the graces of the ſpirit of God in our ſelves, doth draw concluſions that we are united unto Chriſt, as well as the ſpirit of God doth evidence and witneſs it, from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Gods free grace and favour in Chriſt unto ſouls. Now thus are thoſe places to be taken in the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>John,</hi> where the ſpirit of God ſeems to ſpeak moſt of ſuch ſigns: He ſpeaks of them there as following ſigns of a ſouls union, and ſo are demonſtrations <hi>à poſteriori</hi> (as we ſpeak) from the effects, and witneſs the union as the effect witneſſes the cauſe. But the Scripture no where commands the ſoul, to ſeek out the manifeſtation of his union with Chriſt by thoſe, and from thoſe, though they are alſo able to afford ſome witneſs unto his union, in way of confirmation of the evidence of it; when once the ſoul doth behold his union, then beholding his graces, they come in as another window into the ſoul to let in light; Faith and Senſe come in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſo make the ſouls conſolation full and ſtrong.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:48673:37"/>III. The Scripture lays down obedience to God, and love to God, as ſigns of a ſouls union with God in Chriſt, purpoſely to convince deluders of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about their union. It is to convince them of their contrary walking unto ſouls that are united unto God in Chriſt: For though no degree of a ſouls Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience unto God, nor no degree of love in the heart unto God, be able of it ſelf, and from it ſelf, to clear the union of the ſoul with God in Chriſt when it is dark, and to prove that the ſoul is united; yet ſome kind of diſobedience, and of contrary walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto God, may manifeſt that there is no union between God and the Soul. And therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture when it hath laid down any ſuch ſign, always follows it with the contrary unto any ſuch ſign, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that thoſe Souls that walk directly contrary, cannot be ſuch as are united to God in Chriſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhall ſee, no ſooner doth the Spirit of God ſay, <hi>hereby we ſhall know that we love God, if we keep his Commandments.</hi> 1. <hi>John</hi> 2.3. <hi>But he ſaith, he that ſaith he loves God and keepeth not his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is a Lyar;</hi> Preſently he brings the point back for proof to convince Souls of want of union, by that which is an inſeparable effect of the Souls want of union. Yet there are two or three things to be noted about this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Scripture doth not lay down any defect, of any degree of Obedience, or of Love, or of any degree of perfection of thoſe ſigns laid down as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſequences of union, as an argument of the Souls want of union. The Scripture doth not ſay that this degree, or that degree of Love, and this and that manner of Obedience doth follow the ſouls union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:48673:37"/>2. The Scripture doth not lay down, that an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, or any diſorder in the Souls Obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, or in the Souls Love unto God and the like, do manifeſt the Souls want of union. Neither doth he require any perfection in thoſe ſigns laid down as conſequent ſigns of the ſouls union, to make the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoul evident by them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Scripture doth not ſay, that the ceſſation of thoſe Holy Operations, of thoſe Holy Qualities in the ſoul, nor the ceſſation of the acts of love unto God, doth manifeſt that a ſoul is not united unto Chriſt: For there may be a ceſſation of thoſe acts in the ſoul for a ſeaſon, that are the inſeparable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the ſouls union with Chriſt, but there cannot be a total want, or contrariety in the heart to ſuch things as are the proper effects of union. So that he doth place the evidence of the ſouls disjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a contrariety to theſe; as when he ſaith, <hi>by this we know we are paſſed from Death to Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we love the brethren, but he that hateth his Brother abideth in Death;</hi> He that hateth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt needs hate God. So in 1 <hi>John</hi> 4, 5. When he lays down Obedience to Chriſt to be the ground of the knowledge of Chriſt, then preſently he ſaith, <hi>he that ſaith he knows him, and keepeth not his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments is a Lyar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a third queſtion to be opened, and that is this.</p>
               <p>Que. 3. <hi>To what purpoſe are all the promiſes made to Qualities inherent in Souls, and to the workings of the Spirit of grace in hearts, ſeeing <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt cannot be evidenced from them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:48673:38"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. For anſwer, Firſt there is no promiſe the Lord makes to any quality inherent in a ſoul, as a condition upon which the promiſe ſhould be fulfilled to the ſoul. That is, there is no promiſe that the Lord hath made to any quality, ſo, or in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as upon the Lords beholding that quality in the Soul, he ſhould repute himſelf bound to fulfil that promiſe, or to convey that mercy included in the promiſe to the Soul: Nor doth the being of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity lay any ſuch engagement upon God to perform it. Every promiſe is a part of the Covenant of grace that the Lord holds forth in Chriſt; for the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace is nothing elſe but a bundle of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: All the promiſes of God in the word bound up in one, is the Covenant of grace, ſo that it is a thing conſiſting of ſo many Articles of agreement between God and the Soul. Now the Covenant of grace ſhould prove no Covenant of grace, if any of thoſe promiſes were made to a quality, as a condition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Lord were bound to perform the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 2. Secondly the promiſes of God to qualities inherent in Souls, are not made to qualities as qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. That is, not as they are good diſpoſitions, and good inclinations, not as they are works of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace begotten in ſuch Souls. All inherent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in ſouls are to be conſidred under a two-fold notion, either as they are qualities, that is, as they are affections and diſpoſitions in a ſoul: Or they are to be conſidered as they put a ſoul into ſuch a ſtate or condition, as they make a ſoul either in a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or a bad condition. Now no ſoul may look upon any one promiſe that God hath made to any one quality, and look upon that quality in his heart as
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48673:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that good quality, that good diſpoſition to which the Lord hath bound himſelf by promiſe, to convey ſuch or ſuch mercies or benefits. As for example, ſhould I name moſt of the conditional promiſes in the word, you will find none of the promiſes made to qualities, are made to them as qualities, but as to a ſtate of Want, and Penury, and Miſery, out of which the Lord promiſeth Refreſhment, Eaſe, and Relief, out of the Bowels of his own mercy.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To begin with thirſting ones. That notable place in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1.2. <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth, come ye to the Waters, and he that hath no Money, come ye buy and eat, yea come buy Wine and Milk with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Money and without Price.</hi> Come, ſaith he, take all ſutable refreſhment for your poor thirſty ſouls: There is Chriſt holden forth to thirſty ones, in all the precious priviledges tendred to ſouls in Chriſt: Yet this is not made to thirſty ones, as thirſting is a quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or grace, flowing from the Spirit of grace in their hearts. And that the promiſe is not made to thirſting Souls, as thirſting after Jeſus Chriſt, or as thirſting is a quality, will appear in three particulars: in that the perſons to whom thoſe glorious priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are tendred in Chriſt, are perſons void of any quality, or grace, proceeding from the Spirit of grace in their Hearts: They were ſo far from any Holy quality, as it doth appear from the Text, that they had not any one right deſire after receiving any Holineſs, For</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are ſaid to be ſuch as are thirſting after falſe refreſhments digging broken Ciſterns for their Souls to drink of, they ſpent their Money for that which was no bread, that is, their deſires and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48673:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
They were the <hi>Jews</hi> that ſought for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by the Law, and Cerimonies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They were ſuch as thirſted to ſupply their wants in a wrong way, and were neglecters of Jeſus Chriſt. They ſpent their labours and deſires after wrong ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that which was not Bread, things that could not profit: And theſe were the perſons to whom the promiſe was made, and therefore it could not be made to any quality.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſame promiſe is holden forth to every Soul equally, whether thirſting or not thirſting. This you may ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Let him that is a thirſt come</hi> (there is the ſame promiſe) <hi>yea let whoſoever will come, and take of the Water of Life freely.</hi> Every one under Heaven is joyned under as equal a notion as the thirſty ones: Therefore the promiſe cannot be made unto thirſty ones, as having ſuch a quality of grace in them, but as poor and penurious Souls, in a ſad condition, not knowing how to get their Souls refreſhed, and their wants relieved. So again <hi>Mat.</hi> 5, 6. where the promiſe ſeems to have more colour to be made to a quality as a quality, <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled.</hi> This promiſe is not made to Souls as hungering and thirſting after Righteouſneſs, as Holy Diſpoſitions in their Souls, but the promiſe is made to them only as being needy and penurious, as being in want and extremity; Therefore you ſhall obſerve in the promiſe, <hi>they ſhall be filled,</hi> what is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? Nothing to the quality it ſelf, but to the ſupply of the wants of the poor Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you obſerve the promiſes made to humbled Souls, groaning under the burden of Sin, they are not made to any Souls as groaning under the burden
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48673:39"/>
of Sin, or as groaning under the burden of Sin is a quality, or grace in the Soul. As for example, look that promiſe. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> Now ſaith the Soul I am burdened, and therefore I ſhall have reſt: And here I am perſwaded many a Soul ſits down in his being burdened, and not in his coming to Chriſt, and ſo ſits down ſhort of Chriſt. Now that this promiſe is not made to Souls burdened as burdened, but as being in a ſad condition, ready to ſink under grievous preſſures, appears in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard there is nothing promiſed by God, to the Soul remaining in his preſent eſtate. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe holds forth reſt, and eaſe, to the poor burdened Soul, but how? Not as the Soul remains in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eſtate, but through his coming unto Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>Come unto me and ye ſhall have reſt,</hi> that is, receive me as the only refuge of your Souls, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving me by Faith, your Souls ſhall have reſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard there is nothing promiſed in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, to be given to the Soul for the future, more then to other Souls that are not for the preſent bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened under Sin. Whatever is holden forth in this promiſe to Souls groaning under their burden, is held forth in other Texts to Souls not groaning under their burdens, in as equal a manner. There can but two things be held forth;</p>
               <p>Firſt, An invitation to believe. But there is no more ſutableneſs held forth in this promiſe for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation for poor burdened Souls to believe in Chriſt, than there is in other promiſes held forth in Scripture to Souls for preſent not groaning under the burden of Sin. There lies as great an invitation upon every Soul
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48673:40"/>
under Heaven as the burdened, there lies a command upon every Soul, the invitation runs as equally to the dead in Sin, under the greateſt captivity to Satan, as to Souls groaning under the burden of Sin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſecond thing that can be held forth in the promiſe, is Reſt and Refreſhment. Now you ſee that the reſt is held forth to them, to be received for the future only through believing, and ſo it is held forth to every Soul under Heaven: Therefore this promiſe cannot be made to burdened Souls under Sin, as they are ſo burdened, or as they are qualified with any ſuch quality of grace. You will ſay then, what is the meaning of the promiſe? The meaning is this, God diſcovers to poor neceſſitous Souls, where they ſhall have refreſhment. The voice of God from Heaven is, Thou poor neceſſitous Soul, wouldeſt have refreſhment; and thou poor burdened Soul, wouldſt have eaſe? Come to me, caſt thy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon me by faith, and take my word ſaith Jeſus Chriſt, thou ſhalt have reſt.</p>
               <p n="3">III. If you look into promiſes made to mourning Souls; As in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted.</hi> So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1, 2. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, <hi>he ſhall come to comfort thoſe that Mourn in</hi> Sion. But now thoſe promiſes are not made to Mourners as having the quality of ſorrow in their Hearts, as being afflicted for their Sins, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for them; no, not as grieving for the diſhonour done to God by their Sins, as if the Lord ſhould have reſpect to that in the promiſe. And that will appear in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the promiſe were to ſorrow as a quality in the Soul, then it muſt needs be as it is a good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Now were the promiſe made to the Soul as a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48673:40"/>
good quality, it were the happineſs of the ſoul to have the good quality increaſe, and continue in his ſoul: Whereas the promiſe made to the mourning ſoul, is to remove the quality by comfort; comfort and mourning being two contraries. So that if the promiſe were made to ſouls having a good quality in them, it were rather a miſery to have the promiſe than a happineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the promiſe were made to ſorrow as inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, then the ſoul might claim comfort by his mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or becauſe of his mourning. And ſo the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the ſouls comfort ſhould be in the quality inherent in the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If you go on to poverty of Spirit; <hi>Bleſſed are they that are poor in Spirit, for theirs is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</hi> The promiſe here is not made to a ſoul poor in ſpirit, as having that quality in him: For then were the promiſe of giving the Kingdom of Heaven, to be held forth to no ſouls but to thoſe that were thus poor and empty; and ſo the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven ſhould be held forth particularly, as the Lords not being willing to give it to any ſouls but to ſuch as are thus poor in ſpirit, that had a true ſence of their own nothingneſs: And ſo the firſt promiſe were to be received by a ſoul as having true holineſs, and grace in his ſoul, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the receiving of the promiſe by Faith, ſhould not be the firſt act of grace in the ſoul, but the ſight of grace ſhould be neceſſary in the ſoul to make him receive a promiſe.</p>
               <p>There is a fourth queſtion to be anſwered, before we can paſs to the affirmative anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:48673:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>Queſt. 4. <hi>Are not the promiſes made to faith, and believing as believing, that through faith a man can only claim right to the promiſe? Saith the ſoul, ſurely faith is a quality in the ſoul, and if the promiſes be made to faith, they are made to qualities as qualities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Firſt I anſwer, That it is apparent that many promiſes are made to ſouls actually void of faith. Though I dare not ſay without reſpect unto believing for the future, yet I ſay without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent believing. The moſt primary, principal, fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental promiſes are made to ſouls void of faith actually, they are made only to ſinners, and that in their very eſtate of ſinfulneſs, though not properly as they are ſinners; that is, not becauſe they are ſinners, as if ſinners were the qualification of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: But heinous ſinners, in that doleful condition, the Lord makes the promiſe to: As in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15, that precious promiſe, This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chief.</hi> He looks upon himſelf only as a ſinner, in the application of that promiſe, that Jeſus Chriſt came to ſave him. Thus the promiſes of reconciliation are made to ſuch actually without faith, calling them as they are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt as a Mediator between God and them, to make up reconciliation. Thus alſo that of <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.20. <hi>That Chriſt came to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt;</hi> another precious promiſe, yet made to ſouls only loſt, without reſpect to any preſent being of faith in their hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Secondly, I anſwer, that ſome promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are made for the begetting of faith in ſouls, and therefore not made to faith as being a quality in the ſoul, to which thoſe promiſes ſhould be made. As
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48673:41"/>
that promiſe <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>A new heart will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you:</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made for the begetting of the habit of faith in the ſoul, whereby the heart ſhould be changed, whereby the whole work of redemption ſhould be wrought in the ſoul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. Thirdly, I anſwer, That no one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the whole Covenant of grace, is made unto faith as a quality pre-exiſtent in a ſoul. That is, as a quality to be remaining in a ſoul before he claim right to the promiſe. So that no promiſe is made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a believer becauſe he doth believe: The ground of the promiſe is not the ſouls believing; nor the ground of the ſouls particular intereſt in the promiſe is not the ſouls believing, though the ground of the knowledge of that his intereſt is his believing. For if faith ſhould be in a ſoul as a quality, to receive the promiſe, then theſe three things would follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. No promiſe could be fulfilled in, and to a ſoul, before it actually believe. And then either faith it ſelf muſt not be a gift from God unto the ſoul, or elſe the great fundamental gift ſhould be conveyed unto the ſoul, not by vertue of the Covenant of grace, nor by vertue of a promiſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then no ſoul might receive a promiſe, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a promiſe, before he ſaw his own faith. That is, a ſoul, till he could ſay, the Lord hath infuſed the habit of faith into my ſoul, he might not receive any promiſe: The reaſon is plain, whatever the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſhould be made unto, that muſt neceſſarily be ſeen in the ſoul, before the promiſe can be believed. But now what a prepoſterous courſe were this, and what an impoſſible thing, that I ſhould ſee my faith before I do believe, that I ſhould ſee the habit of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48673:42"/>
faith, before there be an act of faith in my ſoul? Nay, rather that I ſhould ſee an act of faith, before ever faith did put forth an act?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then the Covenant of Grace were no abſolute Covenant, neither were it a Covenant void of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. For ſhould the Lord make a promiſe to a quality, as a quality, that quality ſhould be brought in as a condition, to which the Lord ſhould bind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his own promiſe. Then the foundation of any particular ſouls intereſt in the Covenant, ſhould not be in the will of God but in the ſoul it ſelf, through the being of the quality in the ſoul to whom the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is made: But you read in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. The Covenant is holden forth abſolutely, the Lord undertaking every article of the Covenant: The Lord alſo makes the foundation of the Covenant to be his own will alone, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11, to 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 4. Fourthly, I anſwer, That the promiſes that are made unto qualities, do not promiſe any mercy, or grace, or favour unto ſouls, in thoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to which the promiſe ſeems to be made. As look over all the promiſes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> The Lord doth not ſpeak peace here to the burdened ſoul, nor yet comfort, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting and exhorting them to take comfort, becauſe they are burdened, or in their being burdened and groaning under ſin, but doth direct them unto Jeſus Chriſt for their refreſhment; <hi>Come to me and then you ſhall have reſt.</hi> So that promiſe to thirſty ones, <hi>John</hi> 7.37. <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink:</hi> The Lord ſpeaks no peace to them in their thirſting, but ſends them to Jeſus Chriſt to receive comfort abſolutely, as though there were no thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48673:42"/>
in their ſouls. So likewiſe it is of every ſuch promiſe.</p>
               <p>Now from this will follow a direct anſwer to that queſtion,<note place="margin">The uſe of conditional promiſes.</note> of what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and uſe theſe promiſes are of then?</p>
               <p>Firſt, they are of a directive uſe,<note place="margin">Of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective uſe</note> to lead the ſoul to Chriſt. That the ſoul finding himſelf poor and penurious, finding himſelf thirſty, and longing after this refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or that refreſhment, after pardon of ſin, or ſanctification, or receiving more grace, theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are of uſe to lead the ſoul to Jeſus Chriſt, to carry the ſoul beyond broken ciſterns, that he is apt to run to for refreſhment, and to open to him the everlaſting fountain, where only he can have refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The promiſes that ſeem to be made to ſuch qualities, they are of uſe by way of Support,<note place="margin">Support.</note> to underprop the poor ſinking ſoul. The promiſe to poor burdened ſouls, though it doth not preſently evidence to the ſoul, becauſe he is burdened he hath reſt, yet it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens a poſſibility, or probability of reſt, and that doth ſweetly underprop the poor ſinking ſoul, when he is ſinking under his burden. As it was when the poor blind man was come after Jeſus Chriſt, and the Diſciples cryed to him to hold his peace, yet when they told him that Jeſus Chriſt called for him, though he had not his ſight from thence, yet it could not but be ſome refreſhment to him, there was a ground of hope for his ſoul to reſt upon, whereas he ſaw no foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f hope to ſtand upon before.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:48673:43"/>3. They are of uſe for the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of thoſe very qualities in the ſoul,<note place="margin">To beget the qualities.</note> to which the promiſe ſeems to be made. By hearing the Lord inviting poor thirſty, empty ſouls, the eyes of the ſoul are opened to behold his own emptineſs; And by diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of the precious workings of love in the boſom of God to poor ſouls, being ready to communicate himſelf to poor neceſſitous ſouls, without any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition required of them, the hearts of poor ſouls are ſo allured, and ſweetly drawn out after God, that all thoſe holy diſpoſitions and qualities are begotten in them; yea faith it ſelf, to which ſo many promiſes are made. Therefore it is obſervable, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.20. That what is there promiſed to them that turn from tranſgreſſion, that the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies unto Jeſus Chriſt, as fulfilling that very quality, to which the promiſe ſeems to be made, in ſouls, even making them to turn from their iniquity and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; Chriſt ſhall perform the condition; As though it were all one to make a promiſe to a quality in ſouls, or to make an abſolute promiſe, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe begets the condition.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They are of uſe for the revealing unto a ſoul his union with Chriſt,<note place="margin">To reveal to the ſoul its union.</note> when the Spirit of God opens and diſcovers thoſe promiſes unto the ſoul. For though the Spirit of God reveals not unto a ſoul the evidence of his union, from any promiſe made to a quality in this manner, that is, by ſhewing the ſoul the quality in himſelf to which God hath made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and therefore makes the ſoul to draw this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that God is bound to communicate ſuch Grace or Mercy to me; yet the Spirit of God may
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48673:43"/>
reveal to the ſoul his union with Chriſt, in ſuch a promiſe made unto the qualitie by manifeſting the Lords loving kindneſs, and free grace to a ſoul in that promiſe abſolutely, as well to beget the quality to which the promiſe is made, as to fulfill the promiſe. And thus the Spirit of God may make the promiſe made to a quality, all one with an abſolute promiſe. Alſo further, The Spirit of God may alſo, through revealing the ſouls union by ſuch a promiſe, beget that very quality in the heart, and cauſe the ſoul to apprehend the quality to be begotten in himſelf, though it doth not make the ſoul claim right to the promiſe by vertue of the quality.</p>
               <p>Now that which remains, is the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative part of the anſwer,<note place="margin">How a ſoul may know his union with Chriſt.</note> to anſwer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly, How a ſoul may know his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Lord Jeſus? In the giving this affirmative anſwer, there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things alſo muſt be premiſed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Premiſe</hi> 1. Firſt I muſt premiſe this, That in our ordinary phraſe of ſpeech we do make no difference between certainty, and aſſurance of our union with Chriſt, but we call every aſſurance of our union a knowledg of our union, and whatever can make a man infallibly certain he is united unto Chriſt, that we ſay in our ordinary phraſe can give a ſoul a knowledg of his union. And indeed the Scripture doth ſeem to countenance this our phraſe of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as in <hi>Job</hi> 19.25. <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth,</hi> which could not properly be called knowledg of his union with Chriſt, but only the knowledg of faith, building upon the certainty of the Lords word.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:48673:44"/>
                  <hi>Pre.</hi> 2. We muſt know that the Scripture doth make a diſtinction between aſſurances of ſouls union with Chriſt. As in 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.16. Saith he, <hi>We know and believe the love of God the father to us:</hi> He makes a twofold aſſurance, an aſſurance of knowledg, and an aſſurance of faith. Now indeed both the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of knowledg, and the aſſurance of faith, may in a large ſence be called the aſſurance of a ſouls u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt, in regard they have both the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of knowledg. Knowledg is the gathering of a neceſſary truth, from ſome unchangable ground: Now in both theſe aſſurances, of knowledg and faith, the knowledg of the ſouls union with Chriſt ariſeth as a neceſſary truth from an unchangable ground. The word of God is the unchangable ground from which the ſoul by the aſſurance of faith, gathers the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to himſelf, that he is united unto Jeſus Chriſt: And the beholding the peculiar inſeperable effects of a ſouls union with Chriſt, is that unchangable ground from whence the ſoul gathers the aſſurance of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pre.</hi> 3. Thirdly, that both the aſſurance of faith and knowledg are for the moſt part aſſociates, or companions in the ſame ſoul at one time. They are for the moſt part cotemporary, that is, accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, that when one is in the ſoul, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is in the ſoul, that when a ſoul hath aſſurance of faith, he hath alſo the aſſurance of knowledg. And that for a three-fold reaſon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard thoſe graces that are the ground of a ſouls aſſurance of knowledge, are witneſſed, or declared by the Spirit of God to be given to the ſoul. Whenever the Lord reveals from his own word unto a ſoul, his willingneſs to take his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48673:44"/>
ſoul into union with the Lord Chriſt, the Lord doth at the ſame time witneſs to the ſoul, his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to confer and beſtow upon him all the grace his ſoul wants, all the holineſs the hungry or empty ſoul is breathing after: He doth at the ſame time aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the ſoul he ſhall have love and delight in God, he ſhall have poverty of ſpirit, and ſtrength over cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Through the aſſurance of faith, thoſe graces that are the grounds of the ſouls aſſurance of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg are begotten immediately. Now in regard theſe are thus neceſſarily begotten, thence it is the ſight of them cometh to be apparent in the ſoul, at the ſame time that the ſight of a ground for aſſurance of faith is apparent in the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The lively workings and motions of all kind of graces, are excited and ſtirred up in every ſoul, by or through the Lords revealing unto the ſoul, a ground for aſſurance of his faith, of his union with Chriſt. It is then the ſoul mourns for ſin more ſweetly, and melts more preciouſly in the boſom of God than ever before, though it may be there have been ſome heart-breakings under the ſenſe of his wretchedneſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. It is then the ſoul is truly poor in himſelf, and loaths and abhors himſelf more than ever before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pre.</hi> 4. Fourthly, though they be at the ſame time, for the moſt part in ſouls, yet the aſſurance of of faith is the firſt according to order of nature in the ſoul. For it is impoſſible there ſhould be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible evidences of the ſouls union with Chriſt, drawn from his own graces, when there is not ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable ground manifeſted from God unto the ſoul, for the aſſurance of faith. So that the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rance of faith in a right orderly way, never flows
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48673:45"/>
from the aſſurance of knowledg, but the aſſurance of knowledg flows from the aſſurance of faith. And that ariſes upon theſe two grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard it muſt be the manifeſtation of the ground of aſſurance of faith unto the ſoul by God, that doth procure a ground of the aſſurance of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg in the ſoul. That appears thus; The grace, or love, or favour of God, is the ground of the aſſurance of faith: Then the Lord doth draw the the ſoul to aſſurance of faith, when he doth reveal to the ſoul his own particular grace and favour, to take it into union with Chriſt, out of the meer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his own will alone, for no other reſpect whatever but for his own ſake: Now the grounds of the aſſurance of knowledg, are the effects of the grace of God revealed, or the fruit of it; Now thoſe are begotten in the ſoul, not by grace, but by the manifeſtation of grace in particular unto the ſoul: It is through grace revealed, that grace hath its right proper effect in a ſoul; and according to the meaſure of the grace of God revealed to a ſoul, it hath the meaſure and degree of effect. According to that in 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. <hi>We know that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is:</hi> That is, when we behold him, through that ſight, we ſhall be transformed into the Image of God. For the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, you may conſult with divers places, as <hi>John</hi> 15.16. Saith Chriſt, <hi>You have not choſen me, but I have choſen you:</hi> He doth not mean, that they had not choſen Jeſus Chriſt now at preſent as their portion, but they did not chooſe Chriſt firſt: But the manifeſtation of Jeſus Chriſt chooſing their ſouls firſt, is the ground of the ſouls chooſing Jeſus Chriſt. And according to the light revealing to a ſoul Jeſus
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48673:45"/>
Chriſts choice of him, ſo is the degree of ſtrength wherewith the will cloſeth with Jeſus Chriſt in the choice again. Now the choice of Jeſus Chriſt, is the firſt act of any habit of grace, that ever any ſoul brings forth.</p>
               <p>There is no gracious act, truly graciouſly acted by any ſoul, till the will of the ſoul be drawn in, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſight of the Lords chooſing him to union with himſelf, upon which the will alſo chooſeth Jeſus Chriſt into union with him. And again you may conſult with that known place in 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.19. Saith he, <hi>we love him, becauſe he firſt loved us:</hi> Not that from the eſſence of Gods love their love did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, (though that be true) but from the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods love: Now as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Gala.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>Faith worketh by Love:</hi> The very firſt opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the habit of Faith towards Chriſt is by love. The ſoul at the ſame time it reacheth out a hand of Faith, to graſp hold of Chriſt, it reacheth out alſo an hand of Love unto Chriſt. Now then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, the Graces, and workings of Graces, being the only ground for a ſoul to gather aſſurance of knowledge from; and thoſe Graces not being begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a ſoul, but according to the degree of the Lords manifeſtation unto ſouls, a ground of aſſurance of their union with Chriſt; Thence it is, that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Faith muſt needs in order of nature go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the aſſurance of knowledge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The effects of grace, which are always the grounds of the ſouls aſſurance of knowledge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main dark and hidden, and obſcure to the ſoul, when the grace of God, that is the favour of God to the ſoul, remains obſcure and doubtful. The truth of graces appears moſt clearly from their Original, from
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48673:46"/>
whence they ſpring, from the root upon which they grow, in regard other Fruits may have ſo near a reſemblance to them, as they cannot be diſcerned by the eye of the ſoul, that hath ſo much darkneſs in it, whilſt it remains here below: But when the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of grace appears, when the ſoul ſees his love flowing meerly from the love of God to his ſoul, that even becauſe of Gods love to the ſoul, therefore the ſoul loves God again, it is then that love appears in the ſoul to be of the right ſtamp, and indeed never till then. So that till the love or poverty of ſpirit, or mourning for Sin, appear to the ſoul it ſelf to be that which is the proper effect, the proper conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the ſouls union with Chriſt, the ſoul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſatisfied that his graces are of the right ſtamp. Now in regard the effects of grace are doubtful, when the grace of God himſelf to the ſoul is obſcure and hidden; Thence it is, that the aſſurance of Faith muſt go before in order of nature the aſſurance of knowledge, though for the moſt part not in order of time.</p>
               <p>Now theſe things conſidered; when you ask, how the ſoul may know his Union with Jeſus Chriſt? The queſtion muſt be concerning this aſſurance of Faith, and not of the aſſurance of knowledge, for you preſuppoſe your ſelves not to have any uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore obſerve what queſtion you ask; you ask how you may gain an aſſurance of Faith, that your particular ſouls are united unto Jeſus Chriſt? Now this queſtion will divide it ſelf into two que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions. Firſt how ſouls do attain the firſt, certain, infallible evidence of their union with Chriſt? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, How ſouls that do conceive, and judge, and eſtimate themſelves to have attained their union with
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48673:46"/>
Chriſt, may know whether their union be true, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their evidences be right evidences, or whether they be deluſions? The firſt queſtion muſt reſolve e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very poor, doubting, ſcrupulous ſoul about his Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But now obſerve, ſuch ſouls cannot expect ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction from me about the union of their ſouls, nor from any thing that man, or the Wiſdom of man can reveal unto their ſouls.</p>
               <p>And that will appear in theſe four reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard the producing Faith in the ſoul is an act of Almighty Power. As you may ſee <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.19. When he prays that they might underſtand <hi>the hope of their calling,</hi> he prays alſo that they might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and know, <hi>the exceeding greatneſs of his Power to thoſe that believe, according to the working of his Mighty Power, which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead.</hi> It is called a <hi>work</hi> of the Lords <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>a Mighty Power,</hi> that is, a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, as God, as an incomprehenſible eſſence: For it was no other Power than the Power of God as God, <hi>that raiſed Jeſus Chriſt from the dead,</hi> and the Holy Ghoſt parallels that Power that draws the ſoul to believe, with the Power of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The producing the conſequence of Faith of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance in the ſoul, is alſo another mighty work of the Power of God. The conſequence is the peace and Harmony in the ſouls boſom, the ſetling of the poor toſſed ſoul in his own wiſhed for Heaven: Now the begetting ſuch Peace in the ſoul is aſcribed to the Power of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.18, 19. <hi>He creates Peace.</hi> Creation is a work that is proper to God alone as he is God, as he is the infinite Divine eſſence. Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to make ſomething of nothing, and therefore
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48673:47"/>
beyond the Power of all Creatures whatever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It muſt be a ſupernatural Divine light, that can reveal to the ſoul the ground of the aſſurance of Faith. Therefore you ſhall ſee <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.17, 18. how the Apoſtle deſiring that thoſe <hi>Epheſians</hi> might be brought to underſtand the depth of the Covenant of grace in their ſouls, he prays to God that he would ſend into their Hearts <hi>the Spirit of Wiſdom and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> that they might <hi>know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the Glory of his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the Saints. What is the hope of his calling;</hi>] That is, what are the things hoped for, and propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as the objects of hope, in the Lords calling ſouls: You ſee there is a neceſſity both of <hi>the Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation;</hi> Not only of a <hi>Spirit of Wiſdom,</hi> that is, of an habit of Spiritual Life and underſtanding infuſed into the ſoul, but of <hi>a Spirit of Revelation,</hi> that there might be a light of Revelation from the ſpirit, to diſcover thoſe deep hidden things, unto the ſpirit of underſtanding that the Lord hath infuſed into the ſoul. Now all the Revelations of man unto your ſouls ſcrupulous about your union, can reveal no more than an external and outward light, to the outward eye of your underſtanding: And thence it is, your ſcrupulous ſouls can receive no ſatisfaction about your union, from any thing that can be revealed by man unto your ſouls. But I pray, miſtake not, I do not ſay, the ſoul may not receive any ſatisfaction through that as a means, but rather I affirm, that through thoſe Revelations of truths, unto the eye of the natural underſtanding, the Lord doth communicate true light into the ſpiritual un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: The Lord ſtrikes in with the revelation of truths, and puts light upon truths, and puts light into the ſoul to receive thoſe truths.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:48673:47"/>4. In regard the Lord hath appointed a peculiar Officer for that end, and hath deſigned that work of ſatisfying ſouls about their union, for that Officer as peculiar to him alone. Thence you ſhall ſee, the Lord hath given the Officer a name ſutable for that end, which is <hi>the Comforter, John</hi> 14.26, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly he is called as well by that name alone, as the Spirit of God: Now the office of the ſpirit is to <hi>lead into all truth, John</hi> 16.13, and it muſt be truth, that is ſome revelation of the mind of God, that muſt give ſuch ſouls ſatisfaction about their union. Now in regard of all this, it is evident, that ſouls ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous about their union cannot expect ſatisfaction, from any thing revealed by any man to their Souls, but only ſo far as the reſolution of this queſtion will give them ſatisfaction, and that's in two things. Firſt, in revealing to their Souls the inſufficiency of their commonly ſuppoſed grounds from whence they ſeek for evidence of their union. Secondly in raiſing their eyes of expectation, to the right original of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of union. We ſhall now proceed to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of this great queſtion, How ſouls attain the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their union with Chriſt? And yet before this queſtion can be anſwered, it will divide it ſelf into theee Branches. Firſt, from whence, or from what ground, ſouls do attain the infallible evidences of their union with Chriſt? Secondly, by what means do ſouls attain the evidences of their union? Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in what manner thoſe means produce the evidence of the ſouls union with Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:48673:48"/>Queſt. 1. <hi>The firſt queſtion is, from whence Souls attain infallible Evidences of their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, That there is but one only pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ground ſubſtantially, from whence ſouls can expect to receive infallible evidences of their union; and that's the Lords own free promiſe, paſt out of the riches of his own grace alone, to poor deſpiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſouls, wherein the Lord reveals his willingneſs to confer or beſtow the Lord Chriſt upon their ſouls. Now that this free promiſe alone, is the infallible ground, from whence ſouls can receive the infallible evidence of their union, will appear in theſe three particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In regard a Divine word muſt be the proper ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate object of a Divine Faith: And every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular act of Divine Faith, muſt have a Divine word. Thence it is that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. The whole Goſpel, conſidered as the Goſpel, is ſaid to be the word from which Faith cometh, that is, the word which is the foundation of Faith: Not that it is the bare hearing of it that produceth Faith, but through the hearing of the word, the Lord reveals that word unto ſouls to be a true infallible foundation for ſouls to build upon. And thence it is that the Word of God, paſt out from God as a promiſe unto ſouls, is made a ground of true hope unto ſouls: Saith <hi>David. Pſal.</hi> 119.49. <hi>Remember thy word,</hi> [that is thy promiſe] <hi>unto thy Servant, upon which thou haſt cauſed me to hope.</hi> Now the word of promiſe thus conſidered, being the only proper object of Divine Faith; thence it is, that it can only be from a divine promiſe, that a ſoul can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the infallible evidence of his union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:48673:48"/>II. In regard there muſt be a revelation from God, of his free donation, and giving Chriſt unto a ſoul, that muſt be the ground of the act of every aſſuring faith. It muſt be through ſome light and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the ſoul hath of the Lords free will concerning his ſoul, that Chriſt and his ſoul ſhall be one, that any act of aſſuring faith can go out of the ſoul. And that may appear in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard faith reſpects things only as they are revealed by Speech from ſome perſon or other, and reſpects the authority of the perſon ſpeaking, as the ground and foundation upon which it acts, that is, upon which faith does believe. Thus the authority of the Lords ſpeaking was the ground of <hi>Sarahs</hi> faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.11. So the ground of <hi>Paul</hi>'s faith is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thus, <hi>I know whom I have believed, and that he is able.</hi> Now the Lord reveals his mind concerning the eternal condition of ſuch ſouls, only in his promiſe: Thence it follows neceſſarily, there muſt be ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the mind of God, in the word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or the Lords donation or giving Chriſt to the ſoul, before there can follow any act of aſſuring faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It appears, in regard faiths proper exerciſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts only in receiving. Whence you may obſerve in Scripture, that believing and receiving are both put for one ordinarily, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. and Chap. 3.33. So that of neceſſity for every right exerciſe of any act of faith, there muſt be an apprehenſion of ſomething given, that may be received by a ſoul. And thence it is of indiſpenſable neceſſity, that there be an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the Lords giving Chriſt to the ſoul to be one with it, before there can be an act of aſſuring faith in the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:48673:49"/>III. It muſt be from the promiſe from whence the ſoul receives the evidence of his union, in regard there muſt be a particular infallible certainty to faiths eye, in the ground from whence faith of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or faith of evidence doth act. Faith work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only as a receiver, can receive no fuller certainty, or have any fuller confidence in it ſelf, of any thing to be effected or done, than it ſees manifeſt from the grounds, from whence it takes that confidence or aſſurance: Now the promiſes alone are the infallible certainty to the eye of faith; Yea, the Lord accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own unchangable counſel, hath determined that there ſhould be no other certainty, but to the eye of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace, to the end that the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed.</hi> And that's the anſwer to the firſt Queſtion, from whence ſouls do receive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible evidence of their union with Chriſt, which you ſee is only from the divine promiſe. But yet here is another Queſtion ſouls will caſt in, before we anſwer the ſecond, By what means?</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But may the ſoul ſay, Is it not from the ſight of a condition to which the Lord hath made ſome promiſe of Chriſt, that a ſoul doth receive the infallible evidence of his union? It is true it muſt be from a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but the promiſe is not the neareſt ground, the proximate ground, but the remote ground, the furtheſt off ground; And the condition of the promiſe fulfilled in the heart is the neareſt ground, and the immediate ground from whence the ſoul receives the evidence of its union.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For anſwer to it, there are divers things to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and then to come to the direct anſwer of the queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:48673:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Prem.</hi> 1. Firſt, I muſt premiſe, That it is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral received diviſion of the promiſes, that they are either abſolute, or conditional. Abſolute, made and founded upon the will of God alone, and ſo to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed only according to his own will, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will. Or elſe promiſes are made to ſome particular condition to be performed in ſouls, upon which the Lord doth alſo fulfill the promiſe to the ſoul. Now this diviſion divides the promiſes into a Covenant of grace, and a Covenant of works; ſo it is all one with that known diviſion promiſes legal, and promiſes evangelical, promiſes according to the Law, and promiſes according to the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prem.</hi> 2. Secondly, I ſhall premiſe, That there can be no promiſes of the Covenant of Grace proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called conditional promiſes, there being not one condition included in the whole Covenant of Grace to which any one promiſe is made. So that the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the promiſes, into promiſes abſolute, and promiſes conditional, cannot hold rightly in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, but every promiſe conſidered in the Covenant of Grace, are all abſolute promiſes: That is, the revelation of Gods will to ſouls, that the Lord hath ſimply and fully determined to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh, according to the manner, and order, and lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude wherein he doth propound them unto ſouls, and that without any impediment or interruption, ſo that whatever can poſſibly intervene, yet the Lords will ſhall prevail in performing the promiſe. Thence you ſhall obſerve <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.32. that the new Covenant, called <hi>the Covenant of Grace and Love,</hi> is diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the old Covenant God made with the Jews as a Nation, in that it was a Covenant wholly abſolute, containing nothing but promiſes which the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48673:50"/>
to fulfill, whatever can intervene: <hi>Therefore I will not make ſuch a Covenant as I made with your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which my Covenant they brake,</hi> (obſerve that) <hi>but I will make ſuch a Covenant as they ſhall not be able to break,</hi> For, ſaith God, <hi>I will write my law in their hearts, and put my fear in them;</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I will do all things for them: So that there is not one promiſe that can properly be called a conditional promiſe: Indeed improperly I grant, the promiſes of the Covenant of Grace may be divided into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional and abſolute promiſes. Some promiſes of the Covenant of Grace, may be called conditional in this reſpect, that there are ſome limits and bounds ſet to the promiſes; as theſe two great bounds, <hi>his own glory, and his peoples good.</hi> And only in three ſorts of promiſes thoſe limitations hold. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In all temporal promiſes, of temporal bleſſings and favours to his own. The Lord hath not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſed riches, and honour, and proſperity to all the Subjects of the Covenant of Grace, though godlineſs hath the promiſe of this life, and that which is to come; And though he hath tyed his own ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to ſupply them, yet not ſo as it admits of no limitation; but theſe two come in, <hi>the Lords glory, and his peoples own good.</hi> And likewiſe in diſpenſing all bleſſings privatively, that is, the freeing the ſoul from all temporal evils, from afflictions, diſtreſs, and burdens, this freedom is promiſed in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, yet it admits of this limitation, ſo far as it may concern the Lords glory: So that ſo far as the glory of God is advanced, in his peoples groaning under burdens and ſufferings for a time, the Covenant is nevertheleſs fulfilled.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The promiſe of Gods giving the common gifts
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48673:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the ſpirit, God is not bound to them in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, without limitation. Therefore in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. Thoſe common gifts of the ſpirit God diſpenſeth them variouſly; one he fills with them, and leaves another poor and weak, void almoſt of any of thoſe gifts of the ſpirit, that the glory of God may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in that diſpenſation; and certainly every ſoul is not ſutable to manage ſuch a treaſury of common gifts, therefore the other limitation comes in alſo, the ſouls own good.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe conditions or limitations hold only in the promiſes concerning the meaſure, and manner, and order of Gods diſpencing himſelf to ſouls in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative, or poſitive things. All ſpiritual mercies, privative as well as poſitive, that is, the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoul from all temptations, and buffettings of Satan, the preſervation of the ſoul from all deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, this is alſo included in the Covenant of Grace; But it is in this ſence but a conditional promiſe, a limited promiſe, ſo far as may be for the Lords own honour, the ſoul ſhall be free from temptations: Yet now, though in this ſence, under all theſe three heads there be continual promiſes, yet that which is abſolutely neceſſary, for the ſoul cannot be ſaid to come under any of theſe limitations; Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and everlaſting Communion with the glorious Trinity, and with the glorious Saints and Angels, are ſo abſolutely promiſed, as they come not under theſe limitations, but that which is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the ſoul, the Lord hath bound himſelf ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to convey to the ſoul. Yet theſe limited promiſes cannot properly be called conditional, but are abſolute in themſelves, as will appear in three particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:48673:51"/>1. Theſe limited promiſes, thus bounded, are not left in the limitations of them unto the perſons to whom they are made. So that they are improperly called conditional promiſes, in regard conditional promiſes do imply ſome condition to be performed by the parties to whom the promiſes are made: Now theſe limitations of ſuch promiſes, are not in the power of perſons to whom they are made, that they ſhould judg and determine, when for their own good, and for the Lords glory they ſhould have ſuch and ſuch promiſes made good to them, but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the ſole wiſdom of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe promiſes bounded with theſe extents, are ſimply and abſolutely determined by God to be fulfilled, according as they are propounded. Now then is a promiſe abſolute, when without reſpect to any thing whatever that can poſſibly intervene, or be interpoſed, it is undertaken to be fulfilled to the perſon to whom it is made, according to the full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent wherein it is propounded. Now in the full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the propounding of thoſe promiſes, wherein God may have glory, and the ſoul advantage, the Lord hath as abſolutely engaged to give all common gifts of the ſpirit, all outward bleſſings, (whatever poſſibly can intervene) as he hath alſo any part of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe promiſes pertaining to the Covenant of grace, bounded with limitations, are by the infinite wiſdom of God, bounded with ſuch limitations only, as make them to be abſolute love and Grace from God to the ſoul. For indeed thoſe limitations are no other than preventions of what might make ſuch promiſes to have evil interwoven with them as well as good, and then ſhould they not be abſolutely
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48673:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
love: For obſerve all Gods promiſes of temporal mercy to the ſoul, therein come to be love to the ſoul, becauſe God hath bounded with that limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo far as ſhall be for the ſouls own good and advantage. So that from theſe conſiderations, even thoſe limited promiſes prove as abſolute, as all the other promiſes of the Covenant of Grace: So that you ſee there are no promiſes belonging to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, but what are meerly Grace; No condition may come in to challenge any thing in the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prem.</hi> 3. Thirdly, I muſt premiſe, That all thoſe promiſes that ſeem to be made to conditions in ſouls, they are included under one of theſe five heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are made to perſons having ſuch conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in them as put them into a caſe of want and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and ſo the Lord propounds refreſhment to them, ſutable to their wants and poverty. Of this nature are the promiſes made to thirſty and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſouls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe may be no promiſes, but revelations of the glorious priviledges that God doth freely beſtow upon his own people. As to inſtance in thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that ſeem to be made to love to God and Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 14.21. <hi>He that loveth me ſhall be loved of my father, and I will love him, and will manifeſt my ſelf to him:</hi> Here ſeems to be a promiſe made to love, whereas it is only a revelation of the precious privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that belongs to the people of God, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the precious purpoſe of God concerning his own, out of the meer diſpoſition of his goodneſs towards them. If any promiſe ſhould be made to that precious grace of love, methinks this ſhould, it runs every way in the nature of a promiſe: But yet
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48673:52"/>
hence it appears it is no promiſe, made to loving Chriſt, as a condition upon which the promiſe ſhould be fulfilled, in regard that diſpoſition, or precious habit of love to Jeſus Chriſt in the ſoul, is an effect of the Covenant of Grace it ſelf: Now that the Covenant ſhould be made to that which is the proper effect of the Covenant of Grace it ſelf, no man can conceive. And that demonſtration is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to clear all other promiſes of this nature. So if you examine the promiſe made to fear, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.7, 8. <hi>The Angels of the Lord pitch their tents about them that fear him:</hi> It is taken for a promiſe, but it is only the priviledge of the Saints. So likewiſe look to all the promiſes of obedience, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.10. <hi>The Lord reſerves mercy for a thouſand generations, of them that love him and keep his commandments.</hi> There is a large promiſe that ſeems to be made to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: But no ſoul underſtanding the abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God from eternity, can conceive the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of any ſoul ſhould be the motive that ſhould move God to ſhew mercy to the ſoul or body; or that God ſhould bind himſelf to his own people, yielding obedience to him, to become a debtor to their poſterity in reſpect of their obedience; for then the mercies their poſterity ſhould enjoy, ſhould owe their immediate being, and the glory of their being to their immediate anceſtors, and not to God as the immediate cauſe of the being of their mercies: Therefore theſe are only declarations of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the people of God, and all theſe promiſes are only manifeſtations of his goodneſs to them, for the manifeſtation of the riches of his Grace, for refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſpirits, and for the cauſing them to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in the eſteem of others.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:48673:52"/>3. If thoſe promiſes that ſeeem to be made to qualities in the ſoul as unto conditions, be not thus, then they are only deſcriptions of the perſons of thoſe that God doth intereſt in the glorious pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Chriſt, by the ſpecial peculiar Graces that God communicates to them.</p>
               <p>Or elſe 4. They are diſcoveries of the means through which God doth convey thoſe priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Chriſt and of the Covenant of Grace unto perſons. Of this nature is that promiſe which ſeems to be made to a condition, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.17. <hi>Thus ſaith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity, whoſe name is holy, I dwell in the high and holy place, with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble ſpirit.</hi> This that ſeems to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to a ſoul, indued by the Spirit of God with the Grace of Humility, it is but either a deſcription of thoſe perſons whom the Lord doth intereſt in his own ſpecial favour, out of the riches of his own Grace alone; Or elſe it is a precious Cordial given to a poor drooping Spirit, as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in an eſtate of penury and poverty, as one contrite and ready to give up himſelf. Of this nature are all thoſe promiſes made to believing, and repenting: <hi>He that believeth and repenteth ſhall be ſaved:</hi> The promiſe of ſalvation is not made unto faith, as a ſpecial grace of God in the ſoul, nor to the perſon indued with that grace: But the thing it ſelf properly is no promiſe, but rather a deſcription of the means through which the Lord makes his people partakers of the ſpecial privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg he conveys through Chriſt, and of the perſons he communicates them to by their qualities.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:48673:53"/>5. Thoſe words of God that ſeem to be promiſes made unto conditions (if none of the four former things contain them, then) they are deſcriptions given by the Holy Ghoſt, of the way the Lord requires, and inables his people to walk in, while he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates of his own free mercy to them. Of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is that place, ſo miſtaken, <hi>Ezek</hi> 36.27, 28, 29, 30, (which is the greateſt place conceived to be of weight to prove promiſes to be made to conditions) ſaith the Lord, I will do theſe and theſe things for you, <hi>I will bring you into your Land, and make you dwell quietly and ſafely in your Land, and I will ſave you from your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs,</hi> &amp;c. But <hi>v.</hi> 37. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, I will yet for this be enquired of by the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to do it for them.</hi> Generally the ſoul conceives, here is the promiſe, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the promiſe: The promiſe to be the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Mercies; And the condition to be the ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the face of God. But the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt is nothing elſe but to deſcribe the way the Lord requires his people to walk in, whilſt they are in expectation to receive thoſe precious mercies, freely promiſed by God for them. Likewiſe that in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8 47 48. <hi>Solomon</hi> prays for his people, <hi>If they bethink themſelves in the Land, whither they were carried Captives, and repent and make Supplication,</hi> &amp;c. Now ſaith the Soul, here is both the promiſe and the condition of the promiſe: The condition is ſeeking Gods face, humbling themſelves for their Sins, turning to God with all their hearts: And then there is the promiſe that God will deliver them; but they muſt obſerve theſe conditions, elſe God binds not himſelf to give deliverance. Now the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Ghoſt is only this: <hi>Solomon</hi> in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48673:53"/>
here at the dedication of his Temple (the Typical Houſe of God) beſeecheth the Lord that the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of all his people made towards that Temple, (that is, towards Jeſus Chriſt typified by that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) and according to the will of God, that they might be all acceptable to God: Therefore obſerve, <hi>Solomon</hi> in praying doth only deſcribe the frame of ſpirit in Gods people when they come to pray, which is an humble frame, a turning frame from their Sins. Neither doth God make the promiſes in either of both thoſe places, to depend upon any of theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties named, not ſo much as prayer it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Therefore for the clearing theſe Texts, I pray conſider theſe things, which may be uſeful for us for the right underſtanding the Covenant of grace, and the nature of it.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That the duties here required by God from his people, are the way wherein it is his will his people ſhould walk in receiving mercies. They are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent in order of time before the Lords intituling the ſoul to the whole Covenant of grace, and every promiſe contained in it; no nor ſo much as in order of nature: That is, that it muſt be preſuppoſed that the ſoul have performed ſuch and ſuch duties, before it can be preſuppoſed the Lord to have intereſted the ſoul in every promiſe of the Covenant of grace. And that will appear in theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the act of the Lords will alone, before and without any act of the will of man concurring, doth fully intitle the ſoul to every promiſe of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace: Otherwiſe it ſhould be conceived, that there ſhould be ſome good will in man towards God, before there be any good will in God towards man; And ſo ſome act of good will from man to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48673:54"/>
God, ſhould not flow from the acts of Gods good will to the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in regard the performing of that duty by a ſoul, that the Lord requires of it in communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting grace, mercies, and favours to it, is the Lords fulfilling his own Covenant of grace, in, and to the ſoul. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. Now that which is a part of Gods fulfilling the Covenant, cannot go before the Covenant it ſelf. So that from thence are two things that you muſt conclude.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the performing thoſe duties that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, do give no ſoul any title or intereſt in any one promiſe of the Covenant of grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the Lords promiſe to the Soul, hath no dependance upon the ſouls performance of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that God requires him to perform, in reference to Gods communicating mercy to the ſoul. Yet I pray here be cautelous: I do not ſay that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no duty from ſouls, whileſt he is thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating his free grace and mercy unto them; I do not exempt ſouls from duty, but I only exempt Gods promiſe from a dependence upon the duty, and eſtabliſh Gods own promiſe upon its right Baſis and Foundations, which is only his own will and abſolute determination.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond thing you are to obſerve for the clearing of theſe Scriptures is this; That thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties required by God from ſouls in communicating mercies, muſt of neceſſity go before the Lords intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ſoul to many mercies. Though they cannot in order of nature, go before any promiſe of the Covenant of grace, yet in order of nature at leaſt, if not in order of time, they go before the Lords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituling the ſoul to very many mercies, mercies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48673:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of all ſorts: That is, till ſouls have performed thoſe duties God requires, they can claim no right nor title, nor have any right nor title unto many mercies: And all the right their ſouls enjoy to many mercies, may, and muſt be conveyed to them through the performance of theſe duties. As for example, in 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 8.47, 48. God promiſeth deliverance to them out of captivity, and reſtauration of them into their own land, and many priviledges; yet thoſe duties there deſcribed by the Holy Ghoſt to be the way of his peoples approach to him, and ſeeking his face for their return out of captivity, could not but of neceſſity go before, at leaſt in order of nature, to the Lords intituling that people in the mercy of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; ſo that while thoſe duties were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the ſoul, there could be no right, nor ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle claimed of that deliverance by thoſe perſons.</p>
               <p>But now there are four or five things to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the clearing of this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the duties here required by God, though they do, and muſt go before the Lords intituling the ſoul to many mercies, yet they do not, nor cannot go before the Lords intituling the ſoul to any abſolute mercies. Thoſe abſolute mercies are conveyed to the ſoul through the Covenant of grace abſolutely, without any reſpect or reference to any duty whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver performed by the ſoul, ſo as the promiſe of them ſhould have dependence upon the duty in the leaſt degree: But theſe relative mercies are only inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Covenant of grace with limitation, ſo as they are mercies conſidered with ſuch circumſtances, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as being communicated to ſuch perſons, in ſuch order, in ſuch manner, in ſuch degree. Now it is of theſe mercies only, that theſe duties required by
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48673:55"/>
God, may go before in order of nature, to the Lords intitling the ſoul to the mercy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obſerve, Though theſe duties may go before, and ordinarily muſt go before, the Lords intitling the ſoul to ſuch mercies, yet it is not the duty that gives the ſoul the right to thoſe mercies thus to be injoyed. Suppoſe thoſe relative mercies to be conveyed to any particular ſoul, at a ſutable time, in a ſutable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, order, meaſure and degree, every way ſutable ſo as they are mercies, and then all theſe mercies are as abſolutely promiſed in the Covenant of grace, as thoſe abſolute eternal mercies, that cannot but be mercies, however they are communicated.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is not the duty, nor the performance of it, that gives the ſoul the right and title to the promiſe. So that the duty is neither the immediate ground of the ſouls right to the mercy, nor the remote ground, that is, the furtheſt off ground. The furtheſt off ground is the promiſe; The immediate is that which gives them right to the promiſe: Now the ſoul muſt be in the Covenant of grace before the duty be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and being in the Covenant of grace, he hath right to the promiſe through which he partakes of ſuch relative mercies.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Though there be an ordinary neceſſity of theſe duties required by God, preceeding, or going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſouls injoying ſuch mercies; yet it is not the duty ſimply conſidered in its own nature as a duty, upon which this neceſſity lies, that it ſhould go before the ſouls injoyment of the mercies. I mean thus, it is not prayer, that God requires of thy ſoul, that waits for the communication of any mercy or grace, conſidered only as prayer, (which is to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a duty) that this of neceſſity muſt go before
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48673:55"/>
the ſouls injoyment of the mercy; that is, as though the Lord would have this neceſſity to be upon the performing of the duty, becauſe he would have ſomething done by the ſoul, before he will make it partake of his mercies: Only the performance of the duty ſo diſpoſeth the heart, as a mercy ſhall be a mercy to the Soul.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Obſerve further, That the riſe and exerciſe of the duties thus required by God, ſometimes to go before the Lords vouchſafing ſuch mercies to ſouls, can be only from the vertue of ſome promiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Covenant of grace, which the Lord fulfills in a ſoul. For without influences from the Covenant of grace, were there the moſt exquiſit prayers, the moſt continual ſtrong wraſtlings of a ſoul with God, the moſt powerful Mourning and Weepings, and Cryings after God, all could not diſpoſe a ſoul rightly for the injoyment of any of thoſe relative mercies, ſo as they ſhould be mercies unto them, when they are communicated.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a third thing alſo to be obſerved for the clearing of theſe Scriptures, and that is, That theſe duties that are ſometimes precedent in ſouls before their enjoyment of ſuch relative mercies, are abſolutely promiſed to thoſe that are in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, to be effected by God in their ſouls. This you may ſee apparent. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36 comparing <hi>v.</hi> 27. with <hi>v.</hi> 37. In <hi>v.</hi> 37. he ſaith, <hi>I will be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of by the houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to do it for them,</hi> but <hi>v.</hi> 27. he ſaith, <hi>I will put my Spirit in you and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes and my Judgments to do them.</hi> And <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will write my Law in their hearts, and they ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me:</hi> The Lord doth even engage himſelf
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48673:56"/>
abſolutely to work that in their hearts, that he doth require to be done by their ſouls in his communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting mercies to them. Now theſe things being thus cleared, the queſtion that the ſoul propounds can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand. The queſtion was, whether it was not from the ſight of the condition, to which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made and fulfilled in the ſoul, that the ſoul did conclude his right to the promiſe, and ſo had his evidence of union with Chriſt? There being no condition in the whole Covenant of Grace, to which God hath made any promiſe, it cannot be that it ſhould be from the ſight of any ſuch condition, that a ſoul ſhould have his evidence of his union with Chriſt. But then the queſtion will be reſolved into this queſtion.</p>
               <p>Queſt. But ſaith the ſoul, <hi>Doth not the Lord firſt reveal thoſe graces that he deſcribes his own people by, to be in ſouls, and then through the ſight of them clear to ſouls that he hath given them the Lord Chriſt out of his own good will alone through the promiſe; And ſo it muſt be through the ſight of ſuch graces as God deſcribes to be in his people, that a ſoul muſt ſee himſelf to be one of Gods people?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Now to this, I anſwer, Firſt, That the Lord doth reſerve to himſelf his own liberty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his own particular word, from whence he doth reveal to ſouls infallibly their union with Chriſt. The Lord doth not bind himſelf from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing unto ſouls their union with Chriſt, by ſome word deſcribing the Graces of the people united unto Chriſt, nor from ſome word only inviting ſouls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Secondly, I anſwer, That the Lord doth not evidence unto ſouls their union with Chriſt,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48673:56"/>
without the ſight of thoſe graces, in ſome meaſure or degree that the holy Ghoſt deſcribes the Lords own people by. When the Lord reveals his own free gift of Chriſt to the ſoul, he doth reveal to the ſoul his willing accepting of Chriſt ſo given: And that's all one as if I ſhould ſay, the ſoul ſees his own faith, and ſo conſequently doth ſee ſuch graces to be in his ſoul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. Thirdly, I anſwer, That the Lord doth never reveal any Graces of the Spirit to any Soul, as the ground or cauſe of evidencing unto the ſoul his union with Chriſt. There are two things intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Lord never reveals thoſe graces in ſouls, to be that which gives the ſoul right to the promiſe of the gift of Chriſt. The Lord never ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts unto any ſoul, that becauſe there are ſuch and ſuch holy diſpoſitions, or precious heavenly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that he hath communicated to him, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is enclined towards him, and is willing to confer the Lord Jeſus upon him, or to accept him into union through Chriſt: But the Lord reveals himſelf willing to accept ſouls into union with himſelf in Chriſt, as they are conſidered under the notion of poor, deſpicable, worthleſs Souls, without the leaſt good diſpoſition or holy inclination that can poſſibly be imagined in their hearts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Lord never reveals thoſe Graces in the Soul to be the foundation of the Souls aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. That is, the Lord doth not manifeſt to the Soul, that becauſe there are ſuch Graces, or ſuch precious habits in his Soul, therefore upon the ſight of thoſe, the Soul ought to believe the Lords free ſender, and free gift of the Lord Chriſt to it. The
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48673:57"/>
Lord doth not make thoſe Graces to be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Souls faith, So that the Souls hope and comfort ſhould reſt upon the ſight of thoſe Graces, that God ſhould diſcover to be communicated to the Soul. And that will appear in two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If the Lord ſhould cauſe the Soul, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering Graces to be in him, to bottom its hope upon the ſight of thoſe Graces, then ſhould the Graces of the Spirit in the Soul be the object of Faith, and ſo Faith ſhould not be the evidence of things not ſeen, but rather the evidence of things ſeen. Now the Scripture never propounds any holy quality in the Soul to be the object of Faith, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the quality as being inherent in the Soul: It is out of all queſtion, the Scripture propounds believing, without the ſight of any of thoſe qualities, as that which every ſoul ought to ſeek after with his greateſt ſtrength, <hi>John</hi> 20.29.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Should the Lord manifeſt Graces to be in Souls firſt, ſo as to bottom the hopes of their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt upon the ſight of thoſe Graces, then the Lord ſhould not ſettle the faith of ſuch Souls upon an immutable, unchangable ground. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit it ſelf in all its workings, both in regard of the perſon in whom it works, in regard of the manner, and time of ſuch workings, is well compared by Chriſt to the wind, that bloweth where and when it liſteth: And ſo all the graces of the Spirit, and the workings of thoſe Graces, may be ſaid to be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things: and ſhould the Lord ground, the Faith of a Soul upon a changable ground he ſhould walk contrary to his revealed will, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. he hath given two immutable grounds, his word and oath — the Lords will is, there ſhould be everlaſting, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48673:57"/>
unchangable grounds upon which every act of Faith ſhould be built in relation to the Lord Chriſt, that there may be unmoveable and unchangable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 4. Fourthly, I anſwer, That the Lord may, and doth to ſome Souls, reveal Graces to be in them, before he doth evidence unto their Faith their Union with Chriſt. The Lord may manifeſt that there is ſome poverty of Spirit, ſome broken heartedneſs for Sin, ſome precious change, before he doth aſſure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Faith their Union with Chriſt. But then there are two things to be noted for the clearing of this concluſion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Lord doth not reveal the truth of ſuch Graces, to be in ſuch a Soul unqueſtionably, ſo as to enable the Soul to conclude from thence, the acceptance of his Soul into Union with Chriſt. The dreadfull ſtorm of fear and terrour, that may be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen upon the ſoul, may be much alayed, but alas there will be many a wave go over the Soul ſtill.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the evidence of the truth of thoſe Graces in the Soul, holds equal proportion with that evidence the Lord gives to Faith of the Souls Union with Chriſt, or of the Lords free gift of Chriſt to him. The evidence of the truth of thoſe Graces, and the evidence unto Faith runs parallel together; They are dark and clear together, holding one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual proportion. And therefore untill God aſſure the Faith of the Soul, that he is willing to accept him into union with Chriſt, the Soul hath not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable aſſurance of the truth of thoſe Graces that are in his Soul.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="99-202" type="pages">
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 5. It is not the diſcovery of Grace in a poor doubting Soul, but the diſcovery of the Lords
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48673:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
abſolute uncontroulable will, to receive a Soul into union with the Lord Chriſt, that is the ground from whence the Souls Faith is aſſured of his Union with Chriſt, that is the ground from whence the Soul is aſſured of his Union with him. Now this I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to clear from divers particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard the immediate ground of the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the promiſe, or of the Covenant of Grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Soul, can be nothing elſe but the gift of God. Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. <hi>It is of faith, that it might be by grace, to the end that the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed.</hi> And that the immediate ground of the certainty of the promiſe, muſt be gift alone, appears in two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In regard the foundation of all muſt be Grace. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6, 7. <hi>That we might be to the glory of his Grace.</hi> Therefore in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.62, 63. <hi>I will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh my Covenant with thee, and thou ſhalt know that I am the Lord;</hi> There's the abſolute promiſe: What is the end? <hi>That thou mayeſt remember and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more becauſe of thy ſhame when I am pacified towards thee, for all that thou haſt done, ſaith the Lord.</hi> This is ſtrange one would think, that they ſhould be aſhamed and conſounded when God is pacified, and reveals him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be pacified; But here is the myſtery of it, The Lord lays Grace as the foundation of all his ways towards them, purpoſely that the glory of all that God communicates to Souls might be to himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In regard there can be nothing elſe the object of faith. There are but two things that can be grounds of certainty, It muſt be either Grace in God, or Grace in the Soul: Either the love of God,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48673:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or the effects of the love of God in the Soul. Now the effects of the love of God in the Soul are things ſeen, ad therefore not the objects of Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The diſcovery of the abſolute will of God muſt be the only ground of aſſurance, in regard faith can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern no certainty of Gods differencing one ſoul from another, but what the Word of God reveals. Now the Word of God reveals no other ground of the Lords differencing one ſoul from another, but only his own will, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.12.18.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard the ſight of the certainty of the ſouls right, of receiving Chriſt into union with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, doth wholly depend upon a ſight of the certainty of the Lords will to recieve the ſoul into union with Chriſt. Though the Spirit of God hath ſecretly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured the heart, from thoſe dark Viſions of Chriſt, to embrace him truly, ſo as there is a real union between Chriſt and the ſoul, yet the ſoul cannot judg aright of his receiving the Lord Chriſt ſo tendred, to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to his ſoul, till he ſees that he did receive the Lord Chriſt upon the right ground.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In that it is the ſouls duty to receive the gifts of God, in that order wherein the Lord manifeſts his gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of his gifts. Now the order wherein the Lord propounds his gifts, is firſt the gift of the Lord Chriſt, and then the gift of all graces, as the adjunct of the gift of the Lord Chriſt. And thence the Lord invites the ſoul, and commands the ſoul firſt in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt, that ſo it might partake of all the graces of Chriſt, and all thoſe diſpoſitions of Holineſs the ſoul longs for.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In that the Lord judgeth it ſufficient for aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Wavering Trembling ſoul of a poor ſinner,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48673:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fearing the indignation of God againſt him for his ſin. You ſhall read <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. That all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that God gave to <hi>Adam</hi> (when out of queſtion the poor man was in great diſtreſs) was only this, <hi>That the Seed of the Woman ſhould break the Serpents Head.</hi> A meer diſcovery of his abſolute free will, without reſpect to any thing in ſouls themſelves, that he would deliver ſolely by a way deviſed by his own Wiſdom, by a Mediatour, by taking upon him the humane nature, and conquering the powers of Hell, that did then hold poor ſouls captive. Could <hi>Adam</hi> have received no evidence, nor no aſſurance of the Lords accepting his ſoul into union with himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in Chriſt from that promiſe, the ſoul of <hi>Adam</hi> had been left altogether comfortleſs, there being no deſcription given by God, of any graces that his own ſpirit did communicate, to the ſouls of ſuch that he had accepted into union with himſelf.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In regard the patterns holden forth in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of ſuch as have received their union with Chriſt, received the evidence of their union from the Lords abſolute promiſe, from the diſcovery of his will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to do good unto their ſouls. In <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6, 7, 8, compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18, 19. you ſhall ſee <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> the Father of all believers, he received the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Lords bleſſing him in Chriſt, (which is all one with taking into union with Chriſt) only by the diſcovery of the Lords abſolute will towards him. Another pattern you ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.5, 6, 7; In the ſenſe of his own wretchedneſs, crying out, <hi>Wo is me, I am undone,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A Seraphim flew unto him having a live coal in his hand, which he took off the Altar, and laid it upon his mouth,</hi> [you muſt conceive it was done in a Viſion] <hi>and ſaid, loe this hath touched thy
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48673:59"/>
lips, and thine Iniquity is taken away, and thy Sin purged.</hi> Here is an abſolute promiſe of the Lords free love to <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> It gives him no Characters at all, but tells him his Iniquity is taken away, and this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the ſoul of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> as you may ſee <hi>v.</hi> 8. by his readineſs to obey the command of God, <hi>here I am, ſend me:</hi> And the caſe is every, way parallel, only this particularizeth the perſon of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promiſes are holden forth generally, but yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular ſoul is as fully included, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is as abſolutely ſpoken to every ſoul receiving it, as it was unto <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> And it is the light of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that ſhines forth in the promiſe, that doth put as much particularity, and doth as much particularize the promiſe to any one ſoul, as this promiſe was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularized to <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in a Viſion. So that it is from the Lords abſolute will alone, that the ſoul receives a full ground of his union with Chriſt. Thats the firſt branch of the 5th Concluſion.</p>
               <p>The ſecond branch of the fifth Concluſion was, That it was not the diſcovery of the graces of the ſcrupulous ſoul, doubtful of his union, that did thus evidence unto the ſoul his union. Now the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of graces in the ſoul ſtill dark in his union, cannot be in order the firſt ground from whence the ſoul doth receive the evidence of his union. Though at the very ſame inſtant the ſoul may by the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of thoſe graces, ſee his union, and conclude his union from the ſight of thoſe graces, yet in order of nature this is not the immediate ground that gives the certainty to the ſoul. And that will appear,</p>
               <p n="1">I. In regard the gift of the Lord Chriſt, cannot be firſt received of a ſoul by Faith as a ſoul is grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or by the ſoul being conſidered under the notion
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48673:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of a ſoul that hath any Graces, or Holy Habits, or Qualities inherent in him. But the firſt ſight of the gift of the Lord Chriſt to the ſoul formerly dark a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his union, muſt have reſpect and relation to the neceſſities of the ſoul, to whom the gift is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, elſe the gift cannot be cloſed with, as ſutable; Thence it muſt be manifeſted as a gift of a Mediatour, to a poor deſpicable, and deſperate Rebellious Wretch, againſt the higheſt Majeſty of Heaven, to mediate with the great Commander of Heaven, for pardon to ſuch a poor deſpicable Rebel. It muſt be received as a gift of a days man, that may lay his hand upon both partaies, upon God and the Soul as at difference, to make up an union. Whence it is that the Apoſtle in opening the work of receiving the Lord Chriſt by Faith, conſiders the ſoul under the notion of an Ungodly one in the receiving of it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4, 5.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It cannot be that the diſcovery of graces ſhould be firſt in order to ſuch a ſoul, in regard, the firſt manifeſtation of the gift of God to the ſoul, that hath hitherto ſet in darkneſs, muſt be a manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto his Faith of the gift of thoſe very graces: And the graces themſelves conſidered as given, are no proper objects of Faith, and therefore can give no aſſurance unto Faith: But it is only the promiſe wherein the Lord holds forth his free will, both to Chriſt and thoſe Graces, that muſt be the only ground from whence the ſoul can receive the evidence unto his Faith of his union with Chriſt. Thus you have the firſt queſtion opened, the ground from whence ſouls receive the evidence of their union.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be opened is the means by which. What means the Lord uſeth to make the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48673:60"/>
promiſe efficacious for this end, to give the ſoul aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his union with Chriſt. But before we come to anſwer this queſtion, there is another queſtion to be opened, that ariſes from the former.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But ſaith the Soul, can the Lords abſolute promiſe, be the ground from whence the Soul can have the firſt infallible evidence of his union, ſeeing there is no abſolute promiſe of God, wherein he diſcovers his own will to accept any one particular ſoul into union with the Lord Chriſt? All the abſolute promiſes, ſaith the Soul, are made to the Church and people of God; But the Lord in thoſe abſolute promiſes doth not reveal the particular Souls that are his own: Therefore, How can I, or any other know, that I am the particular ſoul in the promiſe, there being no particularizing of any ſoul?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For Anſwer to this Queſtion, I ſhall firſt open what is generally granted by every ſoul, by way of premiſe, for the right underſtanding of things. And then lay down two Concluſions for the full an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of the queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pre.</hi> 1. Firſt it is generally granted by all, that it is by vertue of the Lords abſolute promiſe of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſouls into union with Chriſt, that ſouls are united unto Chriſt. The abſolute promiſe alone is like <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> Ladder, it is the Heavenly Ladder upon which the Lord Chriſt alone comes down into any ſoul. It is the abſolute promiſe that is the precious Golden Chain, that binds the Lord Chriſt to the ſoul, and the ſoul to Chriſt: That the precious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage knot of union is only knit by that Chain of the abſolute promiſe, This will appear in three things.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:48673:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. If it were not by vertue of the abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that the ſoul were united to Jeſus Chriſt, then the abſolute good will unto ſouls were not the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or firſt ground of union between Jeſus Chriſt and ſouls. For the promiſes are nothing elſe but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, or Diſcoveries, of the Lords good will concerning ſouls: Now thence it is, if it were not by vertue of the Lords abſolute promiſe that ſouls were united, then it were not primarily and in the firſt place, by vertue of the determination of the Lords will from eternity; And ſo union with Chriſt ſhould not be a mercy flowing down from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Lords elective love; but rather the firſt and primary cauſe of the ſouls union, ſhould be from ſomething in the ſoul it ſelf, and ſo quite contrary to the ſtream of Scripture truth; it ſhould be <hi>of him that willeth and runneth,</hi> and not <hi>of him that ſheweth mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If it were not ſo, then there muſt be ſome grace acceptable to God, preſuppoſed to be in the ſoul before union with Chriſt, unto which the Lord hath made ſome promiſe of union with him. It muſt be either by vertue of a conditional promiſe, or an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute promiſe, that the ſoul is united: Now if by vertue of any condition, or holy quality in the ſoul, then ſuch a holy quality muſt be conceived to be in the ſoul, as is acceptable unto God: Now if it were poſſible there could be any holy quality conceived to be in the ſoul, acceptable to God before union, then either the ſoul muſt receive ſome holy quality, that flows not from Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo deny the fulneſs of Chriſt, which is contrary to that in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.9. and <hi>John</hi> 1.16: Or elſe we ſhould conclude that ſome graces, ſome holy qualities, ſhould be conveyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48673:61"/>
the ſoul, that ſhould not be conveyed by vertue of the ſouls union, and ſo there ſhould be a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the graces of Chriſt unto the ſoul, when the ſoul ſtill remains a ſtranger to God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If there were the leaſt quality acceptable unto God before union, then the ſoul ſhould be a beloved one of God out of Jeſus Chriſt, and it ſhould not be by his dearly beloved Son alone in whom the Lord is well pleaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pre.</hi> 2. That the firſt proper actings of Faith in union, are ever by, or in the way of the application of thoſe abſolute promiſes unto their particular ſouls. That will appear in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the firſt actings of Faith in union, were not by particular application of thoſe abſolute promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; then the Devils Faith ſhould hold equal propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Faith of ſouls united to Jeſus Chriſt. The Devils themſelves do as fully believe the truth of all thoſe pretious abſolute promiſes, as any united ſoul, and do as fully expect the certain accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them unto the Church of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then ſhould the ſouls dependance upon Jeſus Chriſt, be without the ſight of the ſutable ground for the dependance. The firſt act of Faith can have no ground but the abſolute promiſe of God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard all thoſe graces that are deſcribed in any word of God, that ſhould ſeem to be conditional promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, thoſe are not diſcovered at the firſt actings of Faith, and therefore unleſs the abſolute promiſes prove a particular ground to the ſouls apprehenſion, that the ſoul in that abſolute promiſe ſees the Lord particularly tendring himſelf to accept it into union with Jeſus Chriſt, there ſhould be no ground for that dependence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:48673:62"/>
                  <hi>Prem.</hi> 3. It is alſo granted, that this particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the abſolute promiſe unto Souls, doth go before the actings of any other holy quality in thoſe Souls. Faith being the firſt habit in order of nature (though not in time) that's infuſed into any Soul; It doth alſo in order of nature work and manifeſt it ſelf in acting, before any other habit whatſoever; And therefore the acting of Faith in that particular application of the abſolute promiſe, muſt be before there be a manifeſtation of any other holy quality to be in the Soul. And thence in regard this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar way in applying theſe abſolute promiſes, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any holy quality in Souls, there can be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther word but only the Lords abſolute promiſe, to be the ground from whence this faith can ariſe. This is generally granted of all; And from thence take notice of theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the abſolute general promiſe of God, that is holden forth as made unto the people and Church of God alone, that is a particular ground of the Souls firſt confidence, or adherence unto Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the general abſolute promiſe of God, doth ſpeak particularly to every Soul who attains any right or intereſt in it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſhall anſwer affirmatively, That it is a particular ground of Faith of aſſurance, or a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular evidence to aſſure a Souls Faith that he is united unto Jeſus Chriſt. And that I ſhall open in two Concluſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 1. The abſolute promiſe is ſufficient to reveal to a Souls Faith a certainty of his Union, in regard there is an equivalency in the abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God that runs to all Souls, to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar promiſe that could be made: <hi>Paul</hi> manifeſted as
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48673:62"/>
full a certainty of his acceptance into Union with Chriſt, to be holden forth to him in the abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as if he had had a particular word from heaven, ſaying, thou <hi>Paul</hi> ſhalt be accepted into union with Chriſt: In 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>This is a faithfull ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation:</hi> What is that? <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt came into the World to ſave Sinners.</hi> Here is as far off a remote promiſe as can be, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt came into the World to ſave Sinners;</hi> What then? <hi>Of whom I am chief:</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, The Lord Chriſt came to ſave me; where he makes Chriſt ſent into the world particularly to ſave his Soul: And certainly the ſame promiſe, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to give the Soul that particular certainty that <hi>Paul</hi> did receive, did the ſame light appear from the promiſe as did to <hi>Paul.</hi> But that there is ſuch an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalency in what the abſolute promiſe can give to teſtifie union, to what a particular promiſe gives, appear in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the latitude, or largeneſs, and extenſiveneſs of the promiſe it ſelf. The promiſes that are of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute mercies, and are declared to be the abſolute will of God concerning his peoples Souls, they are all propounded as indefinite propoſitions, that is, without any certain bounds: In that promiſe, Chriſt came into the World to ſave Sinners; there is no bounds ſet to it, neither this kind of Sinner, or that kind of Sinner, ſuch as are thus and thus rebellious, but Sinners. So <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. <hi>Go Preach the Goſpel to every creature:</hi> Preach the Goſpel, What is that? <hi>Preach the glad tydings of Salvation.</hi> It is as much as if Jeſus Chriſt ſhould have ſaid, Go and tell eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Soul, my Father is willing to accept their rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſouls into union with my ſelf: And unleſs this be receive
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48673:63"/>
tendered, the Goſpel is not Preached; Exclude the declaring of Gods will to every particular Soul, to receive him into Union with the Lord Chriſt, and you exclude the Preaching of the Goſpel: And that's the reaſon the Angel, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10. when he brings the glad tidings of Jeſus Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>I bring glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings;</hi> To whom, To ſuch a Nation or People? No, <hi>I bring glad tidings to all people:</hi> There is no other bounds ſet but the World it ſelf. If a man comes under the notion of a creature, he comes under the notion of the promiſe, he cannot ſay but it is the will of God to receive his Soul into Union, if he will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Lord Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It appears in regard of the expreſneſs of the command to every Soul particularly to apply the promiſe, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23. <hi>This is the command of God, that ye believe in the name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And again, <hi>this is the Word of God, that ye believe in the name of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now believing can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain but two things: Either a giving credit to the truth of what the promiſe holds forth; And ſurely this cannot be meant, for the Devils themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as much: Or elſe a receiving unto their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Souls, what the Lord there tenders in Chriſt Jeſus; and if you obſerve it, the Scripture phraſe generally holds forth believing in this ſence. Thence it is that believing and receiving in Scripture are put both for one, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.12. Now that the extent of this command of believing reaches thus far, to a particular application of thoſe abſolute promiſes to themſelves, will be cleared by two particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard all unbelief and the fruits of it, is vertually and eminently forbidden in this command of believing. When any poſitive duty is enjoyned
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48673:63"/>
by God, the contrary muſt needs be forbidden by the ſame law vertually, and all the evil conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of whatever is contrary to the duty enjoyned. Now believing being enjoyned, virtually unbelief and all the fruits of unbelief are forbidden. The fruits of unbelief is doubting, and ſo all doubting of the Lords will to fulfill his promiſe, of accepting the ſoul into union with the Lord Jeſus, that's content and willing to receive Chriſt into Union with him, all this doubting of the will of God is there forbidden vertually, in regard it is contrary to the duty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, becauſe it proceeds from the root, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, which is directly contrary unto faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard the ſtrength of Faith muſt needs be the extent of the command. The Soul is to give credit to the Lord, as a thing unqueſtionably cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the Lord is willing to receive his poor loveleſs Soul into Union with the Lord Chriſt. So that in effect the Lord doth in that command to the Soul to believe, enjoyn the Soul to receive fulneſs of aſſurance from the very promiſe, that the Lord is willing to receive his Soul into union with the Lord Chriſt. Yet do not miſtake me, I do not ſay the command is of ſuch an extent, that it doth expreſly command every one to believe that he is one in Chriſt, for then the promiſe ſhould command him to believe a lye, in regard the greateſt number are at enmity: But the extent of the command is to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Soul, of the Lords willingneſs to receive him into union with Jeſus Chriſt, if he be willing to receive him: And this the Lord enjoyns the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious wretches wherever the Goſpel comes; the firſt command to ſuch rebellious Souls is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God is willing to receive their rebellious Souls into union with himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:48673:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Conclu.</hi> 2. There is as great a fulneſs of ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in the abſolute promiſe, to aſſure the ſoul of his union with Chriſt, as there is to give the ſoul a ground of particular dependence upon God in Chriſt for union. This will appear in two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard confidence of the particularity of the promiſe, is of the Eſſence and Being, both of faith of dependance, and faith of aſſurance. Take away particular confidence of the Lords particular will, towards ſuch a particular ſoul, to receive his ſoul into union with Chriſt, and you deſtroy the faith of adherence: Take away the particular confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and there remains nothing but a bare gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral belief of the truth of the promiſe of God as it is tendered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Both the confidence in the ſaith of dependance, and faith of aſſurance, are of one and the ſame kind. Though indeed that the confidence that the ſoul hath, when he once acts faith by way of aſſurance differs gradually, that is, in many degrees from the faith of dependance and adherence, yet they are both of one and the ſame kind, they are both ſubſtantially the ſame; They are but a confidence of the Lords willingneſs to take his ſoul into union with Chriſt, he receiving of him: Only this differs in a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time; That faith of aſſurance acts that confidence by way of the time paſt, that the Lord out of his good will alone hath received his ſoul into uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt; whereas that confidence that is in the act of dependance or adherence, may work thus, that it is the Lords will now at this preſent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my ſoul into union with Jeſus Chriſt. Now all men grant that the abſolute promiſe is ſufficient to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48673:64"/>
build ſaith of adherence, or dependance upon; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe you muſt take away all grounds upon which a ſoul muſt believe, and you muſt leave a ſoul under a command to believe, having no bottom upon which to ſet his faith.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now proceed to the opening of the ſecond queſtion, and that is,</p>
               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>By what means doth a ſoul receive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible evidences of his union? It hath been determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the abſolute promiſe of God, to give the Lord Jeſus to every poor deſpicable, loveleſs, forlorn ſoul that will receive him, is the only unchangable ground, from whence the ſoul doth firſt gather the certain infallible evidence of his union. But now ſaith the ſoul, By what means is the promiſe made efficacious for this end? How comes it to paſs that the bare abſolute promiſe of God doth manifeſt to the particular ſoul that he is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the anſwer of this queſtion, I muſt firſt premiſe divers things for the right underſtanding of it, and then lay down the anſwer in poſitive Concluſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prem.</hi> 1. Firſt, I muſt premiſe, That the abſolute promiſe of God hath a fulneſs of ſufficiency in it ſelf, to diſcover at all times, to every particular ſoul, in what condition ſoever, under what Temptations, in what clouds and darkneſs ſoever, that the will of God is to receive his particular ſoul into union with Jeſus Chriſt; And that he ſhould accept the good will of God, and receive Jeſus Chriſt into union with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Though indeed the promiſe works this effect very rarely in ſouls, yet at all times the promiſe hath that ſufficiency in it ſelf, and there is no addition made by God to the promiſe, neither by word, nor light, neither by way of particularizing ſouls, nor
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48673:65"/>
by way of comprehenſiveneſs to make it conclude ſouls: Neither doth the ſoul build upon any thing added to the promiſe; But the promiſe it ſelf is the abſolute ground, that the ſoul always builds upon in receiving evidence from it. Now becauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe it ſelf doth not at every time, and in every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, manifeſt unto that ſoul thus his union with Chriſt, to whom it hath evidenced his union, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think ſome ſouls, it is ſomthing ſuperadded to the promiſe: And ſome again are ready on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, to conclude from the poſition it ſelf, that the abſolute promiſe ſhould give the ſoul aſſurance of Jeſus Chriſt, That it muſt be from ſome revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God that is added to the promiſe; A kind of revelation of the ſouls name to be written in the book of life; and ſo the ſoul ſhould not build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the word of God, but upon ſome ſuperadded re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. But neither of both theſe muſt be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; But the promiſe hath always a ſufficiency of light to diſcover to the ſoul the Lords willingneſs to receive him into union with himſelf. Only this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, or diſcovery of the will of God, to be laid as the Tower of the ſouls aſſurance, muſt have a wiſe Maſter builder to lay it: It is with this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation as with other foundations, when the timber is hewed and ſquared fit for a groundſel, it muſt have a wiſe Maſter builder to lay it for a foundation: So the ſoul muſt have inſtruction from the wiſdom of God to lay this foundation, ſo as he may ſee his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſtand firm upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prem.</hi> 2. Secondly, I muſt premiſe, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is imployed by God in a ſubordination to his will, for the effecting any end that is intended by God, that's the means of producing or effecting ſuch
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48673:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an end. This I premiſe that we may underſtand what is meant by means; when we ſay by what means is this promiſe made ſufficient to give the ſoul evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his union; God is to be conſidered as the primary efficient cauſe, upon which all things have their dependance: And all things imployed by God for effecting that, are inferiour cauſes, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God himſelf they are called means; though in reſpect of created cauſes, ſome ſuch inferiour cauſes may be called a principal cauſe. So that whatever is imployed by God, for effecting this end of aſſuring the ſoul of union with Chriſt, that's the means by which the promiſe is made effectual for that uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prem.</hi> 3. Thirdly, I muſt premiſe, That there are divers and various means that do commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur together, for effecting one and the ſame end, though they have divers relations unto the end, and work diverſly for the effecting of it. There may be divers kinds of influences, from divers things, to one and the ſame end; And whatever hath influence into the end, comes under the notion of a cauſe, and in reſpect of the principal cauſe, it comes under the notion of a means. So in this great matter of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing to a ſoul its union with Chriſt, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things that may and do concur, for effecting that bleſſed end in the ſoul, for enabling the ſoul to draw from the abſolute promiſe, the concluſion, that he is united to Jeſus Chriſt; though thoſe various things work in a various manner, and one have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence into the end, and another have another influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſo be looked at as divers in relation to this great matter of aſſurance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:48673:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Prem.</hi> 4. Fourthly, I muſt premiſe, That there are four or five diſtinctions about cauſes or means, that are neceſſary to be underſtood for underſtanding this queſtion, By what means the promiſe is made ſufficient, to evidence to the ſoul his union with Chriſt?</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſoul muſt underſtand the diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Principal inſtrumental efficient cauſe, and the leſs principal inſtrumental efficient cauſe. Though there be properly unto every action but one principal cauſe, yet in reſpect of inſtrumental cauſes, there may be many things that may have the reſpect of efficient cauſes, for the producing one and the ſame thing; though there can be but one principal inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental efficient neither, unleſs it be co-ordinate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You muſt underſtand, That the means or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental efficient cauſes, are divided again into Natural inſtrumental efficient cauſes, and Artificial. The natural inſtrumental cauſe is that which works by its own natural in-bred vertue, that is, by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per diſpoſition of its own, and by a power that it hath in it ſelf, without dependance upon any creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cauſe, though nothing that is an inſtrumental cauſe can be ſaid to work by his own vertue, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the principal efficient cauſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You muſt underſtand, That inſtrumental effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſes are to be conſidered again, either as thoſe that are mediate cauſes, or immediate cauſes. The mediate efficient cauſe is that which contributes ſomething to the producing the effect; That is, that which hath ſome influence into the great effect of the ſouls aſſurance, either directly, or indirectly, though it be but a far off, there being many immediate things that come between, that make up the ſouls evidence.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48673:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The immediate cauſe, that's the cauſe that works ſo immediately that nothing intervenes between the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which is the ſouls aſſurance and the cauſe. That which hath the laſt ſtroke as I may ſay, that's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the immediate cauſe: That which being once effected in the ſoul, the ſoul doth immediately, and without intermiſſion of time, draw the concluſion that he is united to Jeſus Chriſt, that's the immediate efficient cauſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Inſtrumental cauſes are ſuch as either ſolitary efficient cauſes, or combined efficient cauſes. That is, ſuch cauſes as work by themſelves, without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to produce ſuch an effect; Or elſe ſuch as work by other cauſes not without reſpect: There is an efficient cauſe alone, and a concauſe with another, and both contribute aſſiſtance to the ſame thing.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Theſe efficient inſtrumental cauſes are divided again into ſubordinate cauſes, or co-ordinate cauſes. That is, ſuch inſtrumental cauſes, that though they work together, are in a ſubordination to one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental efficient cauſe. Or elſe ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an equal power joyntly together for the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame thing. Its then that efficient inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal cauſes are ſubordinate, when one hath the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, and all have dependance upon one, though many things have influence into the ſame thing. And they are co-ordinate when they have equal depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance one upon another, one not being able to work without another. Now all theſe diſtinctions of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes muſt be underſtood, for a right clear underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this queſtion, By what means a ſoul doth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the evidence of his union? Now theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing premiſed, I ſhall lay down the anſwer in poſitive concluſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:48673:67"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Firſt, I anſwer directly to the queſtion, That there are divers mediate and leſs principal cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that do afar off help ſomething for the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing to the ſoul his union with Chriſt from the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute promiſe. There are divers ſuch cauſes, that are partly artificial, and partly natural: Of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I may reckon up divers; As the miniſtry of the word, in the opening and clearing the nature, the largeneſs of the extent, and the excellency of thoſe abſolute promiſes to a ſoul. Likewiſe the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments, either of Baptiſm or the Lords Supper: The element of water in one, being appointed by Chriſt himſelf in the uſe of it, to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſouls partaking of the death of Chriſt, by being buried in the water; And to ſignifie the ſouls partaking of the reſurrection of Chriſt by riſing out of the water, and ſo conſequently communion with Chriſt in all the effects of his death and life; Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſealing to the ſoul that Jeſus Chriſt died for him, and lived for him. So the other Sacrament, the elements of bread and wine, being appointed by Jeſus Chriſt to ſignifie to the ſoul the breaking of the body of Chriſt, and the effuſion of his bloud; And the application of thoſe elements to him, being ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by which his body ſhall be refreſhed and cleared, being appointed to ſhew the life and nouriſhment of his ſoul to be from Chriſt alone: Theſe Sacraments in their right inſtitution, may be inſtrumental immediate cauſes afar off, to contribute to a ſoul ſomething of his union. So Prayer, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and Chriſtian Conference, enquiring into the freeneſs of the promiſe, and the latitude of it; and every ſpiritual ordinance of God, wherein the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God are brought to any remembrance, may
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48673:67"/>
contribute ſomething to the Souls union with Chriſt, which are properly artificial cauſes, not natural, but of a mixt kind, partly artificial and partly natural. And all theſe being in this kind inſtrumental effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſes, they may be ſaid to be means by which the Soul attains the infallible evidence of his union: And it is very ſeldom (if I may not ſay never) but God uſeth one of theſe means, to clear up to the Soul his union with Chriſt in the abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Secondly I anſwer, That it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>eived that there are three more immediate joynt concurring cauſes, to make up to the ſoul the evidence of his union from the promiſe. Though thoſe forenamed means do work Inſtrumentally for that end, yet there are ſome that do work more inwardly, that are commonly received to be joynt cauſes, working for one and the ſame end, I mean for aſſuring the ſoul from the promiſe, of his union with Chriſt. As</p>
               <p n="1">I. The Irradiation, I mean the bright ſhining light of Faith. That is ſet up as a precious Heavenly Lamp, that ſhines ſo clearly into the dark ſoul, that it makes the ſoul ſee in a ſenſible way that he doth receive the promiſe, and embrace the Lord Jeſus given in that promiſe. Faith gives the ſoul ſuch a feeling experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that it doth receive the promiſe of Jeſus Chriſt given even when it is receiving of it, his ſoul graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Jeſus Chriſt ſo powerfully, as he feels his arms graſp Jeſus Chriſt in the promiſe.</p>
               <p n="2">II. There is the Concluſion renewed conſcience draws, by the ſtrength of ſpiritual and experimental reaſons, that the promiſe is unto his particular ſoul,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48673:68"/>
and that he is united unto Jeſus Chriſt, as appears from the promiſe. The truth of it appears from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>The Spirit of God beareth Witneſs with our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that we are Sons of God:</hi> There is a two fold Witneſs, the Witneſs of the Spirit, and our Spirits, which can be nothing but the renewed underſtanding or conſcience that gives the Teſtimony; and both of them Witneſs at one and the ſame time, and they are both but witneſſing one and the ſame thing, and helping the ſoul to draw one and the ſame Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the ſame time.</p>
               <p n="3">III. There is the manifeſtation of the true inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable effects of union with Jeſus Chriſt to be in the ſoul. That is, the ſouls beholding the very juice of Jeſus Chriſt the precious Vine, flowing down into his ſoul, as into one of his Branches. The ſoul finding the ſame graces that are in Jeſus Chriſt the head, drop down into his Boſom: So that the ſoul concludes he muſt needs be a Member to the Head, having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences from it.</p>
               <p>Now there are three things to be opened about this, which are concauſes which may clear up to our underſtandings what may be ſafely holden forth in theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That none of theſe, neither the ſhining of Faith, nor the Teſtimony of Conſcience, nor the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable effects of union, are concauſes in eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing unto the ſoul, the Will of God in taking the particular ſoul into union with Chriſt. The promiſe it ſelf affords this light to the ſoul, by the ſole aid of the Spirit of God, without reſpect to any Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Inclinations, believing qualifications, whatever can be imagined.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:48673:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. Theſe three are only concauſes in producing to the ſoul the effects of that firſt evidence. That is, in producing in the ſoul the concluſion of his own union with Jeſus Chriſt, that doth ariſe from the firſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Lords will, to take his ſoul into union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it is only the firſt of thoſe three things, which is the ſhining forth of the light of Faith, thats properly a coadjoyning cauſe, in the making up a ſouls evidence from the promiſe of his union with Chriſt. Thoſe two latter do follow after the firſt clear evidence in the ſoul of his union with Chriſt from the promiſe, and ſo cannot come in as joynt concauſes to make up the evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. Thirdly I anſwer, There are indeed three joynt concurring cauſes, for the making up this union to the ſouls Faith, of its union with Chriſt: And that is the Spirit of God, the light of Faith, and the Witneſs of Conſcience, taking the Witneſs of Conſcience only for an experimental knowledge, that ſoul doth receive, and hath received the Lord Jeſus, freely given by God to be one with the ſoul, ſo that Conſcience doth only anſwer as it were like a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Eccho to the ſoul, the voice of the Spirit of God to the ſoul. The Spirit of God revealing the light of the promiſe, or applying the promiſe to the ſoul; The light of Faith ſhewing the ſouls receiving of the promiſe; And the voice of Conſcience conſenting to the voice of the Spirit of God, or giving the Echo to the voice of the Spirit of God in the ſoul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 4. Fourthly I anſwer, There be ſome that may be ſaid to be concauſes, or joyn concurring cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in the evidencing to the ſoul his union in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: Yet they are all but ſubordinate cauſes, to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48673:69"/>
one prime principal cauſe which is the Spirit of God. Should I take theſe three which ſome have conceived to be joynt concurring cauſes, which is the light of Faith, the Witneſs of Conſcience, and the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the inſeparable effects of union, yet all theſe come in a way of Subordination to the principal, Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, Inſtrumental cauſe, which is the Spirit of God; As you may ſee if you look upon the light of Faith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. <hi>We have received, not the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given us of God.</hi> You ſee the internal Viſion, or internal Light they have of any grace, of any gifts, is by the light of the Spirit of God put upon thoſe gifts, or put into the ſoul to diſcern thoſe gifts. So likewiſe of the ſecond, the Teſtimony of Conſcience, whatever Teſtimony Conſcience would give, be it either through practical, or experimental reaſon drawn from the Word of God; Or be it only to bear Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the ſouls own act, and ſo taken only for a ſenſe of the ſouls own beleiving; yet alſo this Witneſs of Conſcience hath its Subordination to that principal cauſe, the Spirit of God; As <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1. When the Conſcience is ſaid to <hi>bear Witneſs</hi> of any good act in the ſoul, its ſaid to be through the Spirit: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dead the Conſcience being altogether corrupt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, the habit of Spiritual Light and diſcerning by which it Judge, being only from the Spirit of God; Thence it muſt neceſſarily follow alſo, that every act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that renewed light that the Spirit of God hath infuſed into the Conſcience muſt be by the Spirit of God: For out of all queſtion, the acting of every habit of grace received, doth as well depend upon the Spirit of God, as the firſt infuſion of it into the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48673:69"/>
ſoul did. And if you look upon the third alſo, which is the manifeſtation of all the effects of union that comes under that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. <hi>All gifts:</hi> All gifts of grace through union, muſt be diſcerned through the Spirit of Wiſdom in the heart, inabling ſouls to diſcern the things freely given them of God; As the Apoſtle doth well Illuſtrate it, <hi>v.</hi> 11, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the light that the Spirit which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived gives to them to diſcern <hi>the gift of God,</hi> to the light of Conſcience to diſcern what is in man: <hi>What man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of man which is in him? Even ſo the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God:</hi> Whereby he makes it evident, that the uſe of the Spirit of God dwelling in the ſoul, is the ſame for the diſcovering of all the workings of the ſoul to it, as the uſe of the Spirit of a man is, to diſcover to him the heart of man as man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 5. Fifthly I anſwer, That the Spirit of God alone is the principal moſt immediate and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inſtrumental efficient cauſe, of the promiſes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videncing to the ſoul his union with Chriſt. Though you ſee there be divers cauſes that may afar off have ſome kind of influence, yet no Influences further then they have a dependance upon the Spirit of God, working in them and through them: And however the ſight of Faith, and the Teſtimony of Conſcience, may in ſome meaſure be ſaid to be concauſes, yet the Inſtrumental efficient cauſe, that hath the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> that which ſtrikes the firſt and laſt ſtroke, that aſſures the ſouls Faith that he is united to Chriſt, thats the Spirit of God alone; Its that which ſet on work all other means for that end.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:48673:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>Now that the Spirit of God alone is this principal, efficient, inſtrumental cauſe, I ſhall clear to you by ſome demonſtrations.</p>
               <p n="1">I. It appears by the general office of the Spirit of God. The Spirit is deſigned to that office alone to reveal truths, or to guide ſouls into all truth, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <hi>John</hi> 16.43. <hi>When the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth,</hi> [and obſerve why] <hi>for he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, but whatever he ſhall hear that ſhall he ſpeak:</hi> He ſhall have a Commiſſion from Heaven as it were, to lead them into <hi>all truth.</hi> Now in this guiding the ſoul into all truth, there are two offices that the Spirit of God is deſigned to: Firſt, the making known of truth to the ſoul. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the application of truth made known.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The making known of truth to the ſoul. It is the office of the Spirit to caſt in the precious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Spiritual knowledge, whereby the ſoul ſhould be any ways apprehenſive of any truth.</p>
               <p>This making known of truth to the ſoul conſiſts in three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the communicating of Spiritual light to the ſoul, or in giving the ſoul a Spiritual eye of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. We are all like poor <hi>Bartimeus, born Blind; The Natural man receiveth not the things of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for they are Fooliſhneſs to him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are Spiritually diſcerned;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14; Now it is the office of the Spirit alone to make a precious Eye Salve, that may reſtore ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſight to the ſoul, and make it capable of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truth; Therefore it is ſaid in 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.20. In Converſion we are ſaid to <hi>receive a mind to know him,</hi> that is a diſpoſition to know him, an underſtanding capable of knowing him.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:48673:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. The Spirit preſents truth to that Spiritual eye t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t that he hath communicated. Therefore in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17. The Apoſtle prays for <hi>a ſpirit of wiſdom and revelation:</hi> Not only <hi>a ſpirit of wiſdom,</hi> that is, an internal ſpiritual habit of ſpiritual light to diſcern truth; But <hi>a ſpirit of revelation</hi> alſo, that is, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting the truth unto the Soul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In making known ſpiritual truths, the ſpirit of God removes all impediments that do prevent the diſcerning of truths preſented. Though the ſpirit gives eyes, and preſents truths, there may be ſuch impediments between the Souls eyes and the truth, that may prevent the Souls diſcerning, There may be ſome films, or ſome corrupt humours, ſome film of luſt or ſelfiſhneſs that may hinder the ſight of the truth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Spirit makes application of the truth known. The firſt truth that God diſcovers to a Soul, which is his own ſin, his guilt, and danger of condemnation, muſt as well be applied to the Soul by the Spirit, as revealed to the Soul by the Spirit: Therefore <hi>John</hi> 16.8. The office of the Spirit is to <hi>reprove,</hi> or <hi>convince the world of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judgment;</hi> to make it clear to the conſcience of every particular man that there is a judgment for him, that he is one of thoſe ſinful wretches that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not. That the Spirit alſo muſt make this appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, will appear in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that there ſhould be an equal and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable ſenſe, of the effects of Sin and Wrath, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure and degree of every ſinners underſtanding ſin and wrath. If it were not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit alone, that did make application of the truth made known, it could not be then, but ſo far as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48673:71"/>
Soul did underſtand what Sin and Wrath was, the effect both of the knowledge of Sin and of Wrath would remain in ſuch a heart: But alas experience e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough teacheth us, that many ſinners that have large knowledge of the nature of ſin, and of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences and effects of ſin, which is Wrath and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, yet have not the knowledge of this effect in the leaſt manner. The effects are two: Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the Souls Judgment; Horrour and anguiſh in the ſenſe of condemnation. He that underſtands ſin rightly in the leaſt degree, underſtand it to be damnable, therefore the effects of it muſt needs be condemnation in his own Soul: But nothing is more common than for men to confeſs every ſin to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and to confeſs themſelves to be ſinners, but far off from drawing a ſentence of condemnation; They will be ſure enough of the concluſion, though they conclude ſin to be damnable, yet they will not conclude themſelves to be in a damnable condition. So if you look upon the ſecond effect that follows the knowledge of Sin, and that's Horrour and Senſe of the dreadfulneſs of that Condemnation: Though it may be ſometimes a ſoul goes ſo far, as almoſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it ſelf to be in a Damned condition, yet far is it from letting it take effect upon his heart, ſo as to lie heavy upon his heart as an intolerable burthen. Therefore it is plain, not only the revealing of the truth, but the application of truth revealed, depends upon the Spirit of God: The Spirit muſt ſay, here is thy Sin, and yonder is the Pit of Miſery, before a man can apply thoſe truths to his own ſoul.</p>

                  </gap>, in regard the Terrours and Horrours for Sin are appropriated by the Scripture to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48673:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and to his work alone. Whence you ſhall ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. Fear is ſaid to be <hi>the work of the Spirit of Bondage: You have not received the Spirit of Bondage again to fear,</hi> that is, the Spirit of Bondage again working Fear, and Anguiſh, and Vexation of ſoul in reſpect of the guilt of Sin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit alone muſt be the principal efficient cauſe in evidencing to the ſoul from the promiſe his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt, in regard of the Spirits particular and peculiar office that it is appointed unto by Jeſus Chriſt. The Spirit hath its office, and that is to Comfort and Refreſh the ſouls of the peculiar ones of Chriſt. Hence the name of the Spirit is, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, <hi>John</hi> 16.17. Now this being the peculiar office of the Spirit of Chriſt, to comfort thoſe that are the the Members of Jeſus Chriſt, it muſt needs be, that that muſt needs be the principal Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal efficient cauſe in revealing to the ſoul his union with Chriſt in the promiſe. And that will appear in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard the Word of promiſe alone is the ground of all Conſolation unto the ſouls Faith. Now the Spirit ſhould give ſouls but ſmall comfort, could he not give them Comfort unto Faith; did not the Lord reveal the everlaſting Inheritance to be theirs, everlaſting Union and Communion with Chriſt to be theirs, and then let them ſee Holineſs in them to be a drop of the Inheritance, that the ſoul ſhall feed it ſelf with to Eternity; the Comfort were but ſmall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard it muſt be by appropriating the thing promiſed, that the promiſe is able to afford any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. There muſt be two things for the ſoul to receive comfort from the promiſe: <hi>Propriety,</hi> and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48673:72"/>
                  <hi>Security.</hi> The Soul muſt ſee propriety, or elſe no love, at leaſt no ſatisfaction to the heart, and while there is not the ſatiating of the ſoul there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Comfort is the content the ſoul hath in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his deſired ſatisfaction: Now whatever the ſoul ſees, it ſatisfieth not till it hath a propriety in it. And till there be a ſecurity in that propriety, he is not ſatisfied, fears and doubts ariſe of loſing it again. Could the ſoul ſee union with Chriſt, unleſs the voice ſay thus, I am thine, and will never ſeparate from thee, it would give no true comfort: The ſoul would be more afraid of the loſs of that happineſs, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the preſent good injoyed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It will appear in regard there is nothing ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to evidence to the ſoul his union from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſatisfyingly but the Spirit. There muſt be an equal authority in the revelation to the ſoul of his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt, to that that was in the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the ſoul of his Sin, Guilt, and Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to everlaſting Damnation, before the ſoul can receive any ſatisfaction, or any true freedom from thoſe dreadful Horrours that poſſeſs a ſoul, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the true revelation of his dreadful eſtate of Sin, Wo, and Miſery. Now its apparent that it is the Spirit of God alone, that reveals with Power, the Condemnation of the ſoul through his own Sin: And therefore unleſs the Spirit of God ſhould come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with another voice, which hath as great a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to pronounce the abſolution of the ſoul from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation through Chriſt, the ſoul could never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any ſatisfaction, nor be free from receiving the ſentence of Condemnation in himſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:48673:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>IIII. The Scripture it ſelf teſtifies that it is the proper, peculiar office of the Spirit: I need quote only that one place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>The Spirit it ſelf beareth Witneſs with our Spirit, that we are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.</hi> When he would riſe to the higheſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he riſes to that, <hi>the Spirit of God Witneſſeth with our Spirit.</hi> There are two or three things in the Text that will clear it, that it muſt be meant the ſpecial o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the Spirit it ſelf, and that by a ſpecial peculiar application of the promiſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is ſaid it is <hi>the Spirit it ſelf.</hi> Intimating it is not the gifts of the Spirit, nor the graces of the Spirit, as ſometimes the Spirit is taken in Scripture: But in a way of diſtinction from graces, he puts the Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis upon it; <hi>the Spirit it ſelf; that Witneſſeth with our Spirits;</hi> Intimating that it is the perſon of the Spirit, whoſe office it is thus to Witneſs to the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He puts it as a diſtinct Witneſs, <hi>it Witneſſeth with our Spirits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is by particular application: <hi>It Witneſſeth to our Spirits that we are the Sons of God.</hi> It Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth Adoption: Now we cannot believe our Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without the Witneſs of the Spirit, and that from a Word; and therefore that can be nothing but the application of the promiſe to the ſoul. Thus you have the ſecond queſtion opened, that is, by what means a ſoul doth receive the infallible evidence of his union. There is a third queſtion.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>In what manner doth the ſoul receive the firſt infallible evidence of his union with Chriſt? It was concluded from the firſt Queſtion, That the abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God receive any Poor, Deſpicable, Loveleſs, Forlorn Soul that would, into <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with the Lord
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48673:73"/>
Jeſus, was the firſt infallible ground of the Souls evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of union: And it was eoncluded that there were various means that did concur together, to inable the ſoul to receive his union from this abſolute promiſe; Though there was one immediate means that works in the promiſe, aſſuring the Souls Faith in the promiſe that he is united to Jeſus Chriſt. The Queſtion now remains, how this means doth produce this end? Or how the Lord worketh in and through theſe means to make the abſolute promiſe efficacious and effectual to manifeſt to the poor doubting ſoul his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the opening of it I muſt premiſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the right underſtanding of it, and then lay down the anſwer to it in poſitive concluſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prem.</hi> 1. Firſt I muſt premiſe, That all the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that any means whatſoever do contribute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the evidencing unto any doubtful ſoul, his union with the Lord Chriſt, only produce the ſame kind of effects, in that ſoul that doth receive the evidence of his union with Chriſt. As ſuppoſe it is through ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the face of God in prayer, that the Lord doth at one time bring to mind the abſolute promiſe, in the clearneſs of light it holds forth, and makes applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that promiſe for the ſatisfying of the ſoul about his union with Chriſt. And ſuppoſe another time the Miniſtry of the Word is appointed by God for the effecting of this end; Still there is the ſame effect begotten by theſe various means, whereby the ſoul is inabled to receive the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his union.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prem.</hi> 2. Secondly I ſhall premiſe, That all the Influences that any means do contribute, for the evidencing from the promiſe the ſouls union with Chriſt, are comprehended under the Influences of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48673:73"/>
ſpirit of God alone. So that the efficacy of the word, or of prayer, or any ordinance towards the effecting of that bleſſed end in the ſoul, may properly be ſaid to be the efficacy of the ſpirit of God, in regard thoſe means contribute not the leaſt in themſelves (otherwiſe than the ſpirit of God imploys them as his own inſtruments) for aſſuring to the ſoul his faith in Chriſt from the promiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prem.</hi> 3. Thirdly, I muſt premiſe, That in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the manner of the working of the ſpirit of God, for aſſuring the ſouls faith of union in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that the ſpirit of God hath not limited himſelf to any conſtant particular order, in aſſuring unto ſouls their union with Chriſt from the promiſe. The ſpirit of God is truly the ſpiritual wind, that blows where, and how it liſteth. There is no limitation propounded in the word, whereby it ſhould appear the ſpirit ſhould bind himſelf, to work in the ſame order in all ſouls, to evidence to them their union with Chriſt. And in like manner the ſpirit of God hath ſet no bounds to himſelf, of any degree of thoſe effects that it doth produce to ſouls, whereby the promiſe is made efficacious, to aſſure to the ſouls faith his union with Chriſt, but it works variouſly in the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prem.</hi> 4. Fourthly, I muſt premiſe, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the manner of the Spirits working in aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the Soul from the promiſe his union with Chriſt, to the full and life of it, is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and inexpreſſable. Surely that in 1 Cor. 2.9. is meant only of thoſe Goſpel joys that are the effects of this union, that eye never ſaw, nor ear never heard, neither did it ever enter into the heart of man (as man) to conceive the things that God hath
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48673:74"/>
laid up for thoſe that love him. And likewiſe well may that place be applied, that no man knows the mind of God but the Spirit of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11, 12. Neither doth any man or Angel know thoſe ſecret diſcoveries of the Lords mind, and opening of his heart to the Souls Faith, whom he doth aſſure from the promiſe that he is united unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prem.</hi> 5. There is a fifth premiſe, Though the Spirit of God neither binds it ſelf in order nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, nor is expreſſed to the life of it in the ſoul, when he doth aſſure to the Souls faith his union with Chriſt, yet the Spirit keeps its conſtant order in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the effects it doth produce in the Soul, to whoſe faith it doth aſſure his union with Chriſt from the promiſe. The effects of the ſpirit are ſuch in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Soul in this work, that they have ſuch a near relation to the aſſurance it ſelf, that the ſoul receives from the promiſe, that thoſe effects are altogether unſpeakable from that evidence of aſſurance. If thoſe effects periſh or decay, the certainty and aſſurance the ſoul hath from the promiſe periſh and decay: And if thoſe effects do but live in the ſoul, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the ſoul hath from the promiſe is maintained; they live together, and die together.</p>
               <p>Now theſe effects that the Spirit of God doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in every ſoul, to whom it doth manifeſt his union with Chriſt from the promiſe, in ſome meaſure or degree, are theſe five, (in the opening of which you ſhall receive the poſitive anſwer to this great queſtion.)</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Spirits Illumination.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Spirits Irradiation of the Goſpel to the Soul.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Spirits conviction of the Conſcience in the Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:48673:74"/>Fourthly, The Spirits excitation, or ſtirring up the habits of faith infuſed into the Soul.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Spirits Atteſtation, or witneſs unto the Soul, the Spirits paſſing the determination fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally upon the Souls whole eſtate. Theſe five kinds of effects are produced by the ſpirit from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that the ſoul is united to the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The manner in which this Spirit works, is by the Illumination of the ſoul:<note place="margin">The ſpirits Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> You ſhall read <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.18. That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle praying that the <hi>Epheſians</hi> might underſtand the hope of their Calling [that is the great things hoped for, in their calling, and the glorious priviledges that they are called out to hope and wait for] his prayer is that they might have <hi>the ſpirit of wiſdom and revelation;</hi> To what end? <hi>That the eyes of their underſtanding being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, they might know what is the hope of their calling.</hi> Obſerve it, The very firſt ſpiritual work of the ſpirit of God to this end, is for ſpiritual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Now the work of the ſpirit in enlightning conſiſts in three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In the infuſion of greater degree of divine light into the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the removal of all impediments from the eye of the ſoul, or from the underſtanding of the ſoul, that ſhould prevent the ſouls ſeeing, or diſcerning the divine light infuſed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the quickening or ſtirring up, or put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into act and exerciſe, the habits of divine light, that the ſpirit of God hath infuſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:48673:75"/>Firſt, this Illumination is an infuſion of greater degrees of divine light into the ſoul.<note place="margin">Infuſion of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degrees of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine light.</note> The ſoul ſits altogether in darkneſs, untill the light of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt ſhines into it in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. Now though there be ſome habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual divine light infuſed by the ſpirit of God, into the underſtanding of every ſoul that is united to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, yet there is after union, a continual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of that divine light: And therefore you ſhall ſee <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.18. The Apoſtle prays, <hi>that the eyes of their underſtanding might be enlightned:</hi> Now if you read the whole Chapter, you ſhall ſee, they were Saints, that were enlightned already. So that this work of the ſpirits enlightening, is the ſtrengthening of the poor weak feeble pur-blind eye of the ſoul; and as we partake of this divine light, ſo we grow up unto the perfect day, till we be like Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, in whom is light and no darkneſs at all.</p>
               <p>The Second thing wherein this work conſiſts is the removal of all impediments, that do hinder the exerciſe of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine light,<note place="margin">Removal of impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſight.</note> that is infuſed into the ſoul. By this ſpiritual light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, the ſight of the eye may be ſtrengthened, and yet through ſome diſtempered humours, a film may grow over the eyes, that it is able to diſcern no object; ſome wateriſh humour, or ſome mote or duſt may prevent the ſeeing of the eye; There may be ſome films of corruption, and of diſtempers, many malignant humours, (as I may ſay) and rheumes that may gather together in the ſoul, and prevent that ſight we ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> from
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48673:75"/>
the ſpirit: And therefore it is the next work of the ſpirit, after the infuſion of greater degrees of divine light, to pluck out of the ſouls eye all the motes, to take off all the films that might hinder the ſouls ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſight. Though at firſt we have received a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of ſeeing, we are like the blind man that Chriſt cured, he ſaw men walking like trees, we ſee the promiſe afar off.</p>
               <p>There are two ſorts of theſe helliſh fogs, or miſts or beams, that the Devil chiefly labours to keep in the ſouls ſpiritual eye, to prevent the ſoul from a right uſe of the divine ſpiritual light received; And both theſe muſt be removed by the ſpirit of God, before there can be aſſurance in the ſoul by the promiſe, that he is united to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There is firſt the helliſh miſt of the principles of darkneſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the helliſh miſt of the darkneſs of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There is the helliſh miſt of the principles of darkneſs. Theſe are like the rheumes that diſtill from the brain into the eyes, whereby the ſight is prevented.<note place="margin">Miſt of the principles of darkneſs.</note> And the helliſh miſts of darkneſs of corruption, are like the diſtemper of Melancholly or Choler, that have their original from the Liver, and ſo fume into the ſouls eyes and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his ſight. Or rather, the firſt is like to a falſe coloured glaſs, that makes all things look of the ſame colour. It were worth the while to conſider of theſe principles of darkneſs; I ſhall name but ſome of the chief of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:48673:76"/>The firſt principle of darkneſs is, That the Lord Chriſt is tendered to no ſouls, but ſuch as truly ſee,<note place="margin">Principle of darkneſs.</note> and are truly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their want of Chriſt. Saith the ſoul, I ſee there is a fulneſs in the Lord Jeſus tendred, but ſaith the ſoul it is only to ſuch as have a ſight of their want of Chriſt, and groan heavily under that want, and I know not whether e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I had a ſenſe of my want of Chriſt; alas I have a blockiſh heart, I am an ignorant wretch, I have a blind underſtanding, I dare not truſt my deceitfull heart, I fear I never had a true fight of the want of Chriſt, and therefore I dare not believe, (leaſt I ſhould preſume) that Chriſt is tendered unto me. This is a main principle of darkneſs; and that it is ſo, I ſhall make appear briefly in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thy conceving the Lord Chriſt is tendred only to thoſe that ſee the want of Chriſt, muſt ſuppoſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a true ſpiritual diſcerning to be communicated to the ſoul, that doth not come from Jeſus Chriſt; Or elſe, that there may be a light remaining in the ſoul from the relicks of nature, which might let the ſoul ſee his abſolute indiſpenſable neceſſity of Chriſt, or elſe he is undone for ever. Now obſerve what a principle of darkneſs this is; It takes away the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar office of Jeſus Chriſt, which is, <hi>to open the blind eyes and give them ſight, Iſa.</hi> 42.7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thou muſt conceive, that the ſoul ſhould have received Jeſus Chriſt, before he is tendred to him. Now no man dare own there ſhould be a ſpiritual light in the ſoul, before the Lord Chriſt heals his blindneſs; And no man can conceive there ſhould be the diſcerning of a ſpiritual object without a ſpiritual light; <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48673:76"/>
ſpirit, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually diſcerned,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. And for the ſecond, that a man ſhould receive Jeſus Chriſt before he be tendered to him, this every man abhors as a great abſurdity. So that it is clear that this is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of darkneſs, one of the motes the Devil would keep in the ſouls eyes. But it is to be obſerved, there are two truths about this thing, that the Devil miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in propounding it as a glaſs to the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is no ſoul that receiveth Jeſus Chriſt, but hath a true ſight, and in ſome meaſure a true ſenſe of his want of Chriſt, and of the indiſpenſable neceſſity of him. Though no true ſpiritual diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can go before the tender of Jeſus Chriſt, yet thus far it is true, that at the ſame inſtant the Lord allures the heart to accept of Jeſus Chriſt into union, he doth beget a true ſpiritual ſight of his abſolute neceſſity of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a ſecond truth that is narrowly miſſed here, and that is, That this ſpiritual ſight of the ſouls abſolute indiſpenſable want of Chriſt, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the ſoul by the ſpirit of God, working through the offer of Jeſus Chriſt to the ſoul. Though ſome conceive there are ſome things that may be called preparations, not begotten by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but as they diſtinguiſh, by the Law ſeparate from the Goſpel; yet they all grant, that no true grace, either of light, ſight, or ſenſe, is conveyed any way but through the Goſpel of Chriſt, and is inſtrumentally an effect of the Goſpel of Chriſt, Now that which is an effect of the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel of Chriſt, muſt be an effect of the tender of Chriſt to the ſoul, for that is the effect of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48673:77"/>
the Goſpel, to tender Jeſus Chriſt to the poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable loveleſs ſoul. Now that this is a principle of darkneſs, I ſhall prove from Scripture. All thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Scripture that offer Chriſt freely muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punged, if this be a principle of light, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>John</hi> 6.37. Where the invitation is free, whoever will let him come; If he have but a will, let him be what he will.</p>
               <p>A Second principle of darkneſs is, That there muſt be a ſight of the actings of the good will of God to the Soul,<note place="margin">Principle of darkneſs.</note> before the Soul can believe any good will of God intended to the Soul in Chriſt. That is thus, ſaith the Soul, ſurely there muſt be a fight of ſome holy diſpoſition, there muſt be a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of ſome readineſs to depart from ſin, and ſome caſting off the principles of corruption, there muſt be a heart ſeeking after God, and praying, and ſupplicating God, before the Soul may conceive the Lord intends any good will to it in Chriſt. Now the darkneſs that is in this principle will appear in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four conſequences flowing from it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If any ſuch holy diſpoſition or inclination be to be diſcerned in a Soul before he is to believe the Lords intending good will to his Soul in Chriſt, then ſome particular effect of ſavour, or ſome acting of the Lords good will, ſhould be received by a Soul beſides the Lords promiſe, and ſo ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed through the receiving of the promiſe unto the Soul: And ſo conſequently the Lord ſhould convey Grace into Souls out of and beyond the bounds of his own Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If any of theſe actings of Grace were to be ſeen in the Soul, before it believes the Lords good will,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48673:77"/>
then ſhould ſpecial Grace be conveyed to the Soul, before engrafting into Chriſt. So that life ſhould come down from Jeſus Chriſt into the Soul, and it ſhould partake of the influences of Jeſus Chriſt, and of the Graces of Chriſt, before he receiveth Jeſus Chriſt himſelf: And upon this ground the Soul ſhould bring forth good fruit, before it be engrafted into Jeſus Chriſt, and become a good ſtock or good tree; and ſo expreſly contrary to the Scripture, an evil tree ſhould bring forth good fruit, a Soul in enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God ſhould bring forth holy diſpoſitions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the Soul ſhould behold the actings of the good will of God towards his Soul, before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the Lord intends good will to his Soul in Chriſt, then muſt the Soul conceive that he may ſee his own Soul beloved actually of God, (even for the preſent) before the receiving of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to make atonement or reconciliation to God for him. The Soul muſt then conceive that there ſhould be acts of friendſhip from God to the Soul, before the Lord Chriſt ſhould ſtep in to make up the union of peace and agreement, before there ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</p>
               <p n="4">4 If the Soul ſhould of neceſſity ſee the actings of Grace in his Soul, before he ſee the Lord intends good will to his Soul in Chriſt, then a divine word ſhould not be the primary or principal ground of the Souls faith, but rather the Graces, or the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Gods good will diſcerned in the Soul, and conſequently all the foundation of ſuch a believing Soul, ſhould be meerly in the Soul it ſelf. Now nothing is more directly contrary to the whole tenor of Scripture, holding forth the ground of faith, than this. <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is ſet forth as a pattern of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48673:78"/>
his faith was onely built upon the word of God, giving authority to it, from the authority of the Speaker, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20, 21.</p>
               <p>A third Principle of Darkneſs is this, That it is Preſumption for the ſoul to beleive, or to receive the promiſe of Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Principle of darkneſs.</note> ſo long as the ſoul ſeeth nothing but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and Diſobedience, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in his heart againſt God. This is another Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred principle of darkneſs, that ſmells much of the ſmoke that comes out of the bottomleſs pit, to dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the light of the Lord Jeſus. And that this is a principle of darkneſs, will appear by ſome few conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard there can be no rebellion, nor no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity healed but by vertue received from Jeſus Chriſt. Sin receiveth its deadly wound only upon the Croſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and it is by vertue of the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the intendment of the death of Jeſus Chriſt, that any luſt cometh to be crucified in any Soul. He alone is the Spiritual Phyſician that heals all diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers: He alone is the ſpiritual Conqueror to ſubdue all the powers that lift up their heads againſt the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Crown of Heaven. Now there can be none of this vertue received from Jeſus Chriſt, but only by fleeing unto Chriſt, and there is no fleeing unto Chriſt but by believing. So that upon this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that muſt needs be a principle of darkneſs, that ſhould keep off from the only healer of all his rebellion, conceiving he may not receive him while he is rebellious, ſeeing he can never be otherwiſe but rebellious, nor can ever have the actings of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion abated in a right way but by receiving of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:48673:78"/>2. The neglect of receiving the Lord Jeſus reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Goſpel to the ſoul, maketh the Rebellion to be of a more Scarlet Die. The more gloriouſly the Lord reveals his mind to a ſoul, the more dreadful is the Rebellion of that ſoul, that neglects Obedience to that mind of God revealed. Now before the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Lord Jeſus, there was but a little Glory of the revelation of the mind of God in the Law, that which is accounted no Glory in reſpect of the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the mind of God in the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10. There is ſuch a tranſcendent glory in the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the mind of God in the Goſpel, that every one that neglects that Glory ſo revealed, proves a tranſcendent Rebel, a Rebel of the higheſt kind, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great Salvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard the Lord Chriſt muſt be received by every ſoul to take away all the Rebellion, and all the Degrees of Rebellion, that every ſoul hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the guilt of to himſelf. Wo everlaſting to that ſoul, that commits but one act of Rebellion to caſt it upon Jeſus Chriſt; The weight of that one Rebellion will ſink the ſoul in hell for ever: And therefore in regard every act of Rebellion muſt be caſt upon the Lord Jeſus, the ſoul ought therefore upon the ſight of his Rebellion to come to the Lord Jeſus, and receive him, that he may free the ſoul by taking that Rebellion upon himſelf; For ſeeing it is impoſſible but all thoſe Rebellions muſt at laſt be caſt upon the neck of Chriſt, and Chriſt muſt bear them, the argument would keep off the ſoul for ever from receiving the Lord Chriſt, as well as keep off for a time, in regard the principle of Rebellion cannot but be acting, ſo long as the union is not made up
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48673:79"/>
between Chriſt and the ſoul. Yet there are two things to be obſerved about this, that are truths.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is Preſumption indeed for any ſoul to receive the Lord Jeſus, that he might have liberty to Rebel. This indeed were to Sin, that Grace might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound: This were to take the Devil by the right hand, and to make a League, a Covenant of Death with him; This were odious and abominable in the eye of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is truth, that it is Preſumption for any ſoul to live or walk in any Wickedneſs, in reſpect the Lord Jeſus hath ſatisfied for his Rebellions. In theſe two caſes it were curſed deſperate Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for a ſoul to have a thought of the Lord Chriſt belonging to him: But to apply the Lord Chriſt to the poor Rebellious ſoul, that hath nothing but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion working in his heart to God, that there might be a Friendſhip between Chriſt and him, that the Wall of Enmity might be broken down, and that there might be a precious amity between God and him; to come thus is no Preſumption, but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God to every ſoul.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A fourth Principle of darkneſs is this,<note place="margin">Principle of darkneſs.</note> That the perſon of the Lord Chriſt conſidered as filled with all glorious excellency, Grace, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all compleat perfection, is to be the object of the ſouls Faith. That is thus, that the ſoul is to receive the Lord Chriſt his own perſon, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him out of love to his perſon; and that the ſoul comes but Hypocritically, ſo long as he receives him by any other act of Faith, that doth not work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the excellencies that are in the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt. Saith the ſoul, every one would be content
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48673:79"/>
to have Jeſus Chriſt as a Saviour, to ſave from Sin; but this is but an Hypocritical coming to Jeſus Chriſt. This is another woful principle of darkneſs; And this will appear by divers Conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord Chriſt as a Saviour is propounded to the ſoul, as the firſt proper object of his Faith. That is, as Jeſus Chriſt was made Sin, and made a Curſe through Sin, for poor deſpicable ſinful ſouls; that is to ſay, Jeſus Chriſt Crucified for Sin, to ſave poor ſinfull ſouls, that muſt otherwiſe have ſunk under the burden of Sin, into the pit of everlaſting Wo. This you ſhall ſee is the way in which Jeſus Chriſt was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to believing ſouls, both in the time of the Law, and in the time of the Goſpel. In the time of the Law it is apprehended, the greateſt repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jeſus Chriſt was thoſe typical Sacrifices, the ſhedding of the blood of Bulls and Goats for the Remiſſion of Sin, as you may ſee <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.22. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhedding of blood there was no Remiſſion:</hi> Now this was to ſignify Jeſus Chriſt Crucified, as the object of thoſe beleiving <hi>Jews Faith.</hi> Look alſo into the times of the Goſpel and you ſhall find Jeſus Chriſt as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as Crucified for Sin, to be looked at as the firſt object of every Beleivers Faith, conſidering Faith as ſaving: You ſhall ſee it in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. That <hi>Paul</hi> comprehends all his Preaching under this, to manifeſt Jeſus Chriſt Crucified to be the object of their Faith, that is, Jeſus Chriſt as a Saviour, as dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Sin. Therefore Faith is called Faith in the Blood of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25. Alſo the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments appointed for the Sealing of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> promiſe, do hold forth Chriſt as a Saviour: Look upon the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper, It holds forth the rending and breaking of the Body of Chriſt, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48673:80"/>
the pouring out of his Blood, and therefore it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Remembrance of his death. Look upon the other Sacrament, the Burying under Water, and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from under the Water, holds forth Jeſus Chriſt Dying, and Riſing; Thus primarily and properly they hold forth Jeſus Chriſt as a Saviour. And that the Lord Chriſt thus as he is a Saviour, is the firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Faith properly as ſaving, will appear in two particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard the formal reaſon or the ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and conſideration of Jeſus Chriſt, as he is the object of Faith, conſidered as ſaving, muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is in Jeſus Chriſt, that doth procure that Salvation. Jeſus Chriſt conſidered as the object of uniting Faith, muſt be conſidered under ſome notion whereby he doth procure this union, and merit or purchaſe the union; Between the act and the object there muſt be a Similarity, a kind of likeneſs, and neer Similitude and Relation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Jeſus Chriſt conſidered in his perſonal excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, in his precious Beauty and Glory, is rather the object of Love, than the object of Faith, that is, the object of Aſſiance and Dependance: Chriſt is not properly to be depended upon as he is Holy, but as he is appointed by God as a Rock to lay the hope of Salvation upon, that is, as a Mediator and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It appears it is a Principle of Darkneſs, In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the moſt ſpecial acceſs of Souls unto Chriſt is as he is a Saviour unto ſouls. The moſt preſſing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are preſt upon ſouls to conſtrain them to come to Jeſus Chriſt, are, that they might come for Salvation: You ſhall ſee it in that Declaration of the Commiſſion of the Apoſtles themſelves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48673:80"/>
20. <hi>Now we are Embaſſadours for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead, be ye Reconciled to God;</hi> As if he ſhould ſay thus, God hath appointed his Goſpel, that we ſhould go out to poor rebels to invite them to come and accept of propoſitions of peace: And you ſee the reaſon of this, <hi>v.</hi> 21, <hi>For he hath made him to be ſin for us, that knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him:</hi> That is, that we might have the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs that God doth convey through him. And in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. you ſhall ſee what is held forth to be the office of Jeſus Chriſt now in heaven; <hi>He is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, all that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them.</hi> I pray obſerve it, here is the loweſt act of faith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, <hi>coming to God by Chriſt,</hi> and you ſee the coming is for Salvation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt conſidered as a Saviour is primarily ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto ſouls. Chriſt in his perſonal excellency is ſutable unto Angels, and Angels will count it their glory to have him their Head, and be married to him as a Spouſe: But it is only as he is conſidered as a Saviour, that he is primarily ſutable unto Souls here below, in regard the firſt thing that is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for ſuch Souls is Salvation. And thence you ſhall ſee, it is the name that God puts upon him, <hi>his name ſhall be called Jeſus,</hi> (a Saviour) and the reaſon is, why? <hi>For he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins, Mat.</hi> 1.21. So that it appears this is another prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of darkneſs, to perſwade ſouls not to come to Jeſus Chriſt for Salvation. Yet there are two things to be obſerved here.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That many excellencies that are contained in the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, by vertue of the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatical
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48673:81"/>
union of the humane nature with the ſecond perſon in the Trinity, may have efficacy upon a ſoul to allure him, to come. God may let the beams of his beauty ſo ſhine forth, as may raviſh the heart in his coming; and though primarily the Souls faith is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon him as a Saviour, yet his love may at the ſame time cloſe with all the excellencies of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The love of the perſonal excellency of Jeſus Chriſt, is an infallible conſequence of the Souls com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt, and flows and proceeds from the Souls receiving the Lord Chriſt as a Saviour, though there be no ſuch true love before coming to Jeſus Chriſt for Salvation.</p>
               <p>The fifth Principle of Darkneſs is, That there muſt be a proportion between the Souls ſorrow for ſin,<note place="margin">Principle of darkneſs.</note> and ſin it ſelf, before it may apply the promiſe of Jeſus Chriſt. Saith the Soul, it is common among Divines to lay down this principle, That a Soul muſt drink ſo many buckets full of the tears of repentance, as he hath drank of the ſtoln waters of ſin: And to this purpoſe ſaith the ſoul, you ſhall ſee that great ſinners had always great ſorrow; Thoſe that were the murderers of Chriſt (<hi>Act.</hi> 2.36, 37.) <hi>were pricked at the heart,</hi> they were much wounded before they had a promiſe applyed to to them: So it is obſerved ſaith the Soul, that <hi>Paul</hi> that was formerly <hi>Saul,</hi> being a notorious ſinner, a blaſphemer, a murderer of the Saints, he was filled with abundance of ſorrow before God applyed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to him, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.11. <hi>Sin taking occaſion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it ſlew me.</hi> So <hi>Luke</hi> 7.36, 37, The woman that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48673:81"/>
was a great ſinner, and called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the ſinner, the woman that was a ſinner: (Say Divines, every one is a ſinner, but this woman is called a ſinner by way of eminency, paſſing the ordinary degree of ſin) now this woman had great ſorrow (<hi>v.</hi> 38.) before ſhe received any word of pardon from Chriſt, ſhe wept and waſhed his feet with her tears: As ſhe drank in buckets full of ſin, ſo ſhe wept buckets full of tears. Now that this is a principle of darkneſs, I ſhall make it clear thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is an impoſſibility that there ſhould be any proportion between a ſouls ſorrow for ſin, and a ſouls ſin. Every iniquity is a tranſgreſſion that hath a kind of infiniteneſs, in regard of the object againſt whom it is committed, which is againſt the infinite God: Now the ſorrow of the ſoul can never riſe thus high, becauſe it can never be ſo ſutable to the will of God, as the other was directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his will. So that you muſt underſtand the meaning of all Divines to be this (as ſome of them diſtinguiſh it) not that there ſhould be an Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical proportion, but a Geometrical proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſin and ſorrow; That is, not that there ſhould be a proportionable ſorrow to ſin, but the greater ſorrow where there have been the greateſt ſins.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It appears, In that the Lord hath left himſelf to his liberty, in the afflicting Conſciences for ſin, before, and in, and after Converſion. God is a free agent, and according to his own pleaſure he fills one ſoul with greater degrees of honour and terrour, and lets him lie longer under woe and anguiſh before he give him any quiet of ſpirit; He ſtrikes one ſoul to death with the keen arrow of compunction, ſhoots at the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48673:82"/>
heart of him, whereas he lets another ſinner be ſet upon the rock higher than himſelf: ſome ſouls God doth prick their hearts with a needle, and others he puts a ſword to them, like a Chyrurgion that lanceth one ſore above another, and yet brings both to a perfect cure: You read of nothing in <hi>Lydia,</hi> but only the Lord opened her heart; And <hi>Paul</hi> was ſtruck with trembling and aſtoniſhment; You read of nothing in the Jaylor but crying out what to do to be ſaved, being in fear of periſhing, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God gives him joy in believing, and calms his ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard there is no command nor injunction from God, that a ſoul ſhould attain the leaſt degree of ſorrow for ſin, before he ſhould dare to apply the Lord Jeſus, and receive him tendered to his poor rebellious worthleſs ſoul. The firſt command that God lays upon every rebel is to accept of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: God in order of nature firſt enjoyns the ſoul to receive Jeſus Chriſt tendered, before the doing any thing whatſoever, before the ſending up one ſigh to God, or breathing out one petition; in regard the Lord commands all poor ſinners at enmity with him, to come near to him only through a Mediator, and no coming by a Mediator, till they apply the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to be a Mediator: And therefore it is ſaid in 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23. <hi>It is the command of God that ye believe in the Lord Jeſus, whom he hath ſent.</hi> And ſo again <hi>John</hi> 6.29. <hi>This is the work of God, that ye believe on whom he hath ſent:</hi> As if there were no other work of God but this; But the meaning is, that this is the prime principal work, without which all other are but works of darkneſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In regard the Lord takes no pleaſure nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the perſon of any ſinner moſt dejected and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48673:82"/>
plunged into the deepeſt gulf of ſorrow for his ſin, before he applys the Lord Jeſus tendered to his ſoul, more than he did in that ſoul before there was any of that ſorrow. Do not miſtake me, I do not ſay, that the Lord does as much abhor a ſinner that is now forbearing the acts of his enmity againſt God, and is faln to cry after God, as much as the acts of ſin before gradually; But yet I ſay, there is as true an abhorrence in the boſom of God, of all thoſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, mournings and tears, as there was of thoſe acts of ſin, the difference is only in degree. Saith he <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. <hi>To the impure all things are impure, whilſt the mind and conſcience is defiled:</hi> And who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? whileſt the ſoul is altogether unclean, it is impoſſible a clean deſire and motion, or a clean tear can come from thence: So that now the ſoul is looked upon as an enemy, as a Rebel, a Traitor to the Crown of the Lords glory, whilſt he remains a refuſer of the Lord Jeſus tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though he be brought to great degrees of mourning.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In regard the neareſt proportion of ſorrow that can be attained unto for ſin, muſt proceed from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the Lord Jeſus tendered. The ſoul can never diſcern what the degree, or the heinouſneſs of his ſin was, till he beholds the Lord Jeſus accepting his poor deſpicable, rebellious, loveleſs ſoul. Therefore it is worthy your obſervation, that the ſame woman that is called <hi>the ſinner,</hi> by way of emphaſis and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.37. drank deeply of the cup of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, whoſe tears flowed forth in abundance, that ſhe could waſh the feet of Jeſus Chriſt; This womans ſorrow did not proceed from a ſight of her ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her applying the Lord Jeſus tendered, but from
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48673:83"/>
a ſight of the Lord Jeſus accepting ſuch a deſpicable deſperate ſinner as ſhe was: The depths of ſorrow were never broken up in her heart, till ſhe ſaw the arm of the Lord Jeſus reached out to embrace her poor deſpicable ſoul. You ſhall ſee it plain if you compare <hi>v.</hi> 37, 38. with <hi>v.</hi> 47, 48. The whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between Jeſus Chriſt and the <hi>Phariſees</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her, is worth our obſervation for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of it; when Jeſus ſees this woman come and waſh his feet, he knew the <hi>Phariſees</hi> hearts roſe againſt her, becauſe <hi>ſhe was a ſinner:</hi> Now Jeſus put forth a parable or ſimilitude, <hi>Simon, ſaith he, there were two debtors; the one ought five hundred pence, and the other fifty, and when they had nothing to pay, the creditor fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nkly forgave them both: Tell me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which of them will love him moſt?</hi> Simon <hi>anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſaid, I ſuppoſe he to whom he forgave moſt: ſaith he, thou haſt rightly judged.</hi> Now obſerve it, when Jeſus Chriſt had opened to the <hi>Phariſees</hi> this parable, it amounts to this, The cauſe of her mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is from the ſenſe of the Lords forgiving her, for ſhe loved much; <hi>And he ſaid unto her, thy ſins are forgiven:</hi> This he opens to be the cauſe of her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that ſhe ſaw Jeſus Chriſt had exerciſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to her: She ſaw the love of Chriſt ſo infinite, ſo unſpeakable, his compaſſions ſo incomprehenſible, that though ſhe had been ſuch a deſperate wretch, that Satan had had his Throne in her heart, though ſhe had been the Ring-leader of ſinners in a City, yet he was ready to waſh her forlorn ſoul, and make her clean, and this made her ſhe knew not how to expreſs her love, but ſhe wept: So that the cauſe of her tears was not ſo much the ſenſe of her ſin, but the having ſo much forgiven her. So it is obſerved
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48673:83"/>
of <hi>Peter,</hi> when he could deny Chriſt thrice, and forſwear him, and not Weep, when Chriſt looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, his Heart melts and he Weeps bitterly: What <hi>Peter?</hi> doſt deny me? what, me that left the Throne of my Glory, to ſtand here before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Seat, ſaith the look of Chriſt to the Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Peter?</hi> this melts his Heart.</p>
               <p>The ſixth Principle of Darkneſs is this,<note place="margin">Principle of darkneſs.</note> That it is very Dangerous for any ſoul to apply to himſelf the Lord Jeſus too ſoon. It is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly illuſtrated by this Similitude: If a Chirurgeon applies ſome healing Salve to a dangerous ſore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Corroſives have had their proper effects, if he doth not by Corroſives firſt eat out all the dead Fleſh, and by Tents ranſack the Wound to the very bottom, though the Wound be skinned over, it will Feſter and Ranckle again, and that to the danger of the Patients Life. Likewiſe, faith the ſoul, it is thus in regard of the Wound of Sin: If any ſpiritual Phyſician ſhould apply the Lord Jeſus too ſoon to the ſoul, to heal the ſouls Wounds, before the Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of Terrour, and Fear, and Horrour, have had their proper effects upon the ſoul, it may be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the Deſtruction of the ſoul. Or thus, ſaith the ſoul, there may be nutritive nouriſhment to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Patients, that may be deſtructive to ſome ſick Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, in regard there ought firſt to be ſome Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, before there be a ſutableneſs to the giving ſuch Cordial Potions: Likewiſe if the pretious Cordials of Comfort that are in the Boſom of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhould be applyed to the ſoul, before there hath been the bitter Pill of Terrour, of Sorrow and Anguiſh, and Horrour for his Sin given, they may be rather
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48673:84"/>
deſtructive to the ſoul; So that this is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, ſaith the ſoul, to apply the Lord Jeſus too ſoon. This Principle of Darkneſs hath commonly three Grounds, or three Foundations upon which it ſtands, and the ſoul conceives a three-fold Foundation is not eaſily ſhaken, and therefore conceiveth the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be very firm.</p>
               <p n="1">I. It is built upon this ground, That all Divines generally have concluded that it is dangerous to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Comfort to afflicted Conſciences too ſoon, and that it is deſtructive to give Comfort before the ſoul be fitted for it. And indeed if we look over all thoſe Famous men, as <hi>Calvin, Greenham,</hi> and that skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Phyſician Mr. <hi>Rogers, &amp;c.</hi> not one of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Miniſters, but we may extract ſome ſuch Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages as theſe from them, as, Take heed you apply not Comfort too ſoon after you be Wounded; Take heed you take not away the Corroſive and apply healing to ſoon: If you take away the Tent, ſaith one of them, before the corrupt matter be healed, it will heal of it ſelf too ſoon, and break out moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly; Thus if the Tent of Fear and Horrour, and Soul-Affliction for Sin, be taken out of the Wound of the ſoul too ſoon, the ſoul take Comfort too ſoon, the Wound will be ready to heal too ſoon, and ſo will either break out more dangerouſly, or elſe it will be the everlaſting death of the ſoul. But obſerve how ſouls miſtake this ground, in conceiving theſe expreſſions, to be ſufficient ground upon which to build ſuch a Concluſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The meaning of theſe Divines in giving theſe cautions to take heed of applying Comfort too ſoon, is only this, that ſuch as deal with Afflicted Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, muſt take heed they do not too readily aſſure
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48673:84"/>
them that the promiſe of Life in Jeſus Chriſt belongs to them, and that they are certainly accepted in the Covenant of Grace: Now indeed theſe Comforts may be applied to the ſoul too ſoon; for this is not, nor ought to be, the firſt application of Jeſus Chriſt to ſouls. The very firſt act in the ſoul, in its appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Lord Jeſus to it ſelf, is not, that the Lord Chriſt is my Saviour, and that he hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed my ſoul, and Purchaſed Life and Eternal Salvation for me; Thus indeed a ſoul might apply Jeſus Chriſt too ſoon: But the firſt application of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to the ſoul, is the applying the Lords Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Lord Chriſt unto the particular ſoul; It is an aſſuring of the ſoul, from what it beholds in the Declaration of the Will of God from his Word, that it is his Will to receive his ſoul into union with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and that it is the Will of God concerning him, that he do embrace Chriſt to be one with him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obſerve, That it is upon different grounds, that a ſoul doth receive aſſurance unto his Faith that he is united to Jeſus Chriſt, and that other ſouls do manifeſt any Confidence that the ſoul is united to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. There is one ground for the ſouls own apprehenſion that the promiſe belongs to himſelf, and it is upon another ground that any ſoul may apply a promiſe, by way of aſſuring the ſoul that he hath an intereſt in the promiſe. This will appear in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ground from whence the ſoul receiveth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance to his own Faith of his union with Chriſt, is inviſible to all others when it is firſt viſible to the ſoul it ſelf. The Lord may and doth frequently by his own Spirit, ſo open the very ſecrets of his Heart and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48673:85"/>
Mind unto a particular ſoul, and his willingneſs, his longing deſire to accept him in Chriſt, as he doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get yernings in the ſoul to Chriſt, and beget a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed cloſe between Chriſt and that ſoul; but alas! no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eye but his own ſeeth this bleſſed cloſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe grounds upon which any other may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure a ſoul, that he is united to Jeſus Chriſt, are but the Conſequence of the ſouls own Apprehenſion of Chriſts acceptance of it into union with him. So that obſerve, If the ſpiritual Phyſician ſhould apply Comfort in their ſence to the ſoul, that is, aſſure the ſoul of his preſent intereſt in the Covenant of Grace; he may do it indeed too ſoon, becauſe he can have no ground for ſuch a Confidence that he is united to Jeſus Chriſt, till he hath applied Jeſus Chriſt in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to his own ſoul, and that application hath brought forth ſome preceious Fruit, that is, till it hath brought forth Contrition, and Godly Sorrow, Emptineſs, Nothingneſs, a ſight of the ſouls own Sinking, Periſhing condition, till it hath brought forth Gaſping, and Longing, and Panting after Jeſus Chriſt, no Spiritual Phyſician hath any ground to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or tell the ſoul that he is Confident that he is united to Jeſus Chriſt, and this is that that theſe Divines call Comfort: And therefore they propound three or four things as neceſſary to be diſcerned by every Spiritual Phyſitian, before he apply Comfort to them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſay they, it is neceſſary that the Spiritual Phyſician behold the ſoul Wounded in the ſenſe of his Sin: ſenſible of the Wrath and Indignation of God that is due unto his Sin, and ſenſible of the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidableneſs of Wrath and Indignation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:48673:85"/>Secondly, ſay they, it is neceſſary the Spiritual Phyſician ſhould diſcern in the afflicted ſoul, a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, Cordial, Upright, Single Purpoſe and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, an abſolute Reſolution to abandon all thoſe Sins, a purpoſe to Hate them, and Loath and Abhor them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſay they, that he muſt diſcern a ſincere purpoſe, to be conſtant in a Univerſal way of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto Jeſus Chriſt, to receive him as his only King, and Ruler, and Governour, to be obedient to his Will alone.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is neceſſary that he diſcern earneſt Longings, and Pantings, and Breathings after Jeſus Chriſt, an unſatiable thirſt after him, ſuch a thirſt as none can quench but Jeſus Chriſt alone, ſuch a thirſt as makes him ſo priſe Jeſus Chriſt, that if all the World were turned into a Mountain of Gold, it were nothing to him in reſpect of Chriſt; and this thirſt, ſay they, muſt be diſcerned by the Spiritual Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician to be only after the imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, that is, that he may be free from Sin, and have the Pardon paſs'd from Heaven to his ſoul, and have the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to ſtand pure and clean, and Innocent before God, and then, ſay they, the Spiritual Phyſician may apply Comfort to the ſoul. So that it is apparent from their own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, what they mean by cautioning ſouls to take heed they do not apply Comfort to afflicted Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to ſoon. And yet further theſe Divines in their application of Comfort alſo acknowledge, it can be but in a conditional way, that any one can lawfully aver to a ſoul, and aſſure it from the Word, that the promiſe of Life belongs to him, and that be is in the Covenant of Grace: For ſay they, it muſt be
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48673:86"/>
only upon this condition, that thoſe things I named before be Truly, and Really, and Sincerely to be found in the ſoul. So that in effect there is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that is applyed by them unto the afflicted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: And I muſt confeſs, I ſee not any ſafety that can be concluded from the Word of God, in appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Comfort in this way unto afflicted Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, in regard it muſt rather eſtabliſh the ſoul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Humane Authority than a Divine.</p>
               <p n="2">II. A ſecond ground of this Principle is this, That the promiſe of Life and Salvation doth not ſtrait way belong to every ſoul that is Wounded, and Terrified and Afflicted in Conſcience, but it is only to ſuch as are truly afflicted, that is, ſuch whoſe Hearts are truly Broken, and truly Contrite, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.2. Now herein are two miſtakes to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That though it ſhould be true, that the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Life and Salvation, are made only to ſuch as were thus Broken and Contrite, (the contrary to which you have heard formerly opened) yet firſt the tender of the promiſe of the gift of Jeſus Chriſt, is made to ſouls that have not the leaſt degree of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, nor the leaſt degree of Sorrow. That is to ſay, the Lords Declaration of his Will, to receive every ſoul that will, into union with Jeſus Chriſt, is as well propounded to ſouls not having the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Contrition in their Hearts, as it is to thoſe that are the moſt Contrite, and the moſt Broken.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the promiſe of Life and Salvation were made only to thoſe that were Contrite, yet that Contrition could proceed from nothing elſe, but the particular application of the Lord Jeſus to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48673:86"/>
All fulneſs is appointed by the Father to dwell in Chriſt, and whatever grace the ſoul receives, muſt be an Influence that flows down from the grace of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">III. There is a third ground and that is this, That it is for the Glory and Honour of God, and for the advantage of the ſoul, that it ſhould lie under af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of Conſcience, and under the Burden of his Sin ſome time, before he doth apply the Lord Jeſus. Here I muſt Premiſe one thing, and that is, That the Glory and Honour of God, is the reſult of all his ways to his people. The Lord being the Fountain of Wiſdom, cannot work without an end; And his own ſelf alone, that is, the manifeſtation of his own Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is the higheſt end; Therefore of neceſſity, in all the ways of God, that end muſt be attended. This Premiſed I anſwer,</p>
               <p>That properly and by it ſelf, the ſouls lying under the Spirit of Bondage or affliction of Conſcience for Sin, is neither for the Glory of God, nor for the ſouls advantage. It is ordinarily concluded that the ſoul lying under the Spirit of Bondage, doth make for the manifeſtation of the Glory of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the Glory of his Juſtice to the Soul. Saith the ſoul, it makes much for the magnifying the Juſtice of God, in the eye and Heart, that the ſoul hath deſerved according to juſtice, to be plunged into the everlaſting Pit of Wo, that he is liable to all the dreadful Torments, that the Wiſdom of God can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent againſt ſuch a curſed Rebel, for breaking ſuch a Righteous and Holy Law: And it magnifies juſtice alſo in the eyes of others, when others ſhall ſee that thoſe ſouls do acknowledge themſelves, that they did expect nothing according to the ſtrictneſs and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48673:87"/>
of juſtice, but everlaſting Wrath and Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it doth make for the magnifying of God in his mercy. Say they, it makes mercy more ſweet to the ſoul, and more highly to be prized by it, when the ſpirit of bondage hath lain upon the ſoul, and afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the conſcience for a time. Now though at firſt view it ſhould ſeem thus, yet properly the afflicting the ſoul for ſin; that is, the ſpirit of bondage work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fear and terrour for ſin, doth not magnifie God neither in his juſtice nor mercy.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It doth not magnifie God in his juſtice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly. And that will appear, becauſe the magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the juſtice of God in the heart of any, is only by cauſing it clearly to apprehend his own infinite worthineſs to lie under the wrath and indignation of God to all eternity. Now the ſoul is thus made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of his worthineſs, to have the utmoſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God executed upon him, only through re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Lord Jeſus tendered. There are two things that muſt neceſſarily concur to make up this apprehenſion of his worthineſs to have juſtice execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in his utmoſt indignation upon him, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to make juſtice to be ſanctified in any ſoul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A ſpiritual diſcerning to behold the nature of ſin. Now this muſt be received from Jeſus Chriſt, and that by infuſion of influences from Chriſt to the ſoul, by vertue of union between Chriſt and the ſoul. A ſpiritual object cannot be diſcerned in the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of it but by a ſpiritual eye; Now both the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God and ſin when looked upon aright, it muſt be by a ſpiritual eye that is ſutable to apprehend ſuch an object.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:48673:87"/>2. There muſt be a diſcovery of the dimenſions of ſin, that is, the height, length, and breadth of it, before there can be a ſanctifying the juſtice of God in the heart. Now the dimenſions of ſin are only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to the ſoul, through the application of the Lord Jeſus tendered. Till the ſoul ſeeth the right object againſt whom ſin is committed, he never ſeeth ſin in the heinouſneſs and abominable wickedneſs of it: Now the ſoul never apprehends God aright till he beholds him in Jeſus Chriſt, as the object againſt whom he hath committed all his wickedneſs. So that the aggravations of a ſouls ſin appearing only from the right apprehenſion of Jeſus Chriſt, thence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears it doth not make for the glory of the juſtice of God, that the ſoul ſhould lie a time under affliction of conſcience for ſin, in regard the Juſtice of God is more exalted and magnified in the heart, in one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the right application of the Lord Jeſus, than it can be in twenty years, ſhould the ſoul lie under the affliction of conſcience all that time, not applying the Lord Jeſus to himſelf. Neither can the juſtice of God be more magnified in the eyes of others, in caſe the ſpirit of bondage lieth upon it for a ſeaſon before the tender of Jeſus Chriſt, more than it can by the application of that tender immediately as ſoon as he is tendered. The juſtice of God is magnified before others, only by diſcovering before them his thoughts of himſelf, of his own unworthineſs, and deſert ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to juſtice, to be everlaſtingly tumbling up and down in the gulf of wo and miſery: Now the cleareſt apprehenſion of the unſpeakableneſs of his own unworthineſs, proceeds only from the tender of Jeſus Chriſt to his ſoul.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:48673:88"/>Secondly, Hence alſo it neceſſarily follows, That the name of God is not properly magnified in his mercy in the ſoul that partaketh of it, by the ſpirit of bondage working upon the heart for a ſeaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the application of the Lord Jeſus to the ſoul. The more clearly the ſoul apprehends its own wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched rebellion, and curſed trechery againſt the Crown of the Lords glory, the more clear is the Lords mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy manifeſted to the ſoul; Now this is made more apparent by the application of the Lord Jeſus to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, than it could be though the ſoul could diſcern the dreadfull everlaſting burnings: Nay, if he could diſcern by a ſenſe and feeling, the juſtice of God reaching of him; though he were in hell for a ſeaſon, and ſhould partake of the puniſhment of the Devils; that could only make him ſee the merit of ſin, but it could not make him ſee himſelf worſe than a Devil.</p>
               <p>There is a Second branch of this ground, and that is for the ſouls advantage and benefit, that he does for a time lie under the heavineſs and weight of his own iniquity, and not dare to apply the Lord Jeſus. There are alſo two reaſons rendred of that.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Say they, it doth drive the ſoul more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently to the Lord Jeſus for juſtification, life, and ſalvation, and ſet the ſoul in a more hot perſuit af-Jeſus Chriſt, ſo as not to be ſatisfied without him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Say they, it hath advantage for ſanctification, in regard fear makes him depart from iniquity, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue more vehemently after holineſs from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For anſwer to this, Firſt, I muſt premiſe thus much, That the Lord can, and doth improve every provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence whatever, for the fulfilling of his own will in a ſoul; So that the Lords will being effectually to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48673:88"/>
draw a heart to the Lord Chriſt, to make him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of holineſs, and of union with himſelf; the Lord can, and it may be doth improve, the affliction of the ſouls conſcience for ſin for that end, to put him upon a violent purſuit after Jeſus Chriſt: But I ſay this is only accidentally; But properly and by it ſelf, the ſouls reſting under affliction of conſcience for his ſin, before the applying the Lord Jeſus to himſelf, doth not in any meaſure make for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the ſoul, in preſſing the ſoul one ſtep towards Jeſus Chriſt, either for juſtification or ſanctification, either for life, union with God in Chriſt, or holineſs. And that will appear in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard all apprehenſions of God out of Chriſt, do but drive away the ſoul from the preſence of God, and terrifie and amaze, and aſtoniſh and afright the poor ſoul. I mean thus, ſo long as the ſoul looks upon God, and doth not behold the Lord willing to accept his poor deſpicable ſoul, in that precious Mediator the Lord Jeſus; the more it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the juſtice of God, and the more it feels of the effects of his juſtice in the conſcience, the further the ſoul runs from God. No ſooner had <hi>Adam</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed the will of God, and had his conſcience wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but he fled from the preſence of God when God called him: Thus when <hi>Judas</hi> was ſenſible of his ſin againſt God, preſently he went and hanged himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard it is only through the infuſion of the habit of grace into the ſoul, that the heart is any way drawn towards Jeſus Chriſt. Saith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man can come unto me except the father draw him:</hi> So the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee.</hi> The heart is altogether oppoſite to leave thoſe curſed ways of enmity againſt Jeſus
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48673:89"/>
Chriſt, after the longeſt time that ever any ſoul lay under the affliction of conſcience for ſin, till the Lord, by an infuſion of a precious habitual diſpoſition from Chriſt, inclines the ſoul to receive Jeſus Chriſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p>Now that this is a principle of darkneſs, we ſhall make it appear divers ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſimilitude it ſelf by which the ſoul illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates this principle of darkneſs, is meerly imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and improperly applyed to the ſouls caſe. The ſimilitude you know was, that there muſt be corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives applyed to the wound, to eat out the dead fleſh, before a healing medicine be applied. Now this is improperly applied to the ſouls caſe, in regard there is no medicine to be applied, neither corroſive, nor lenitive, but only the Lord Chriſt himſelf, for he is the only <hi>balm of Gilead.</hi> It is Jeſus Chriſt alone by the power of his own death in the fleſh that ſlew ſin, and it is he only that hath power againſt ſin and hell, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 68.18. <hi>he led captivity captive,</hi> That is, Sin, Death, and the Devil, that led poor ſouls captive. Now Jeſus Chriſt being the only Medicine to heal Souls, I ſhall retort the Souls own Similitude againſt it ſelf by way of contraries. You ſay there muſt be a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive applied to the Soul before a lenitive; that is, before there be a healing medicine there muſt be ſome gnawing thing, ſome tent to ranſake the wound: Now I ſay, Jeſus Chriſt being the only medicine, the danger will be far greater in not applying the Lord Jeſus preſently, in regard there is no ſalve either corroſive or lenitive, that is applied to the Soul where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Jeſus Chriſt is neglected. If it be dangerous to the body to apply lenitives before corroſives, then how dangerous is it to leave the Soul without any medicine at all?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:48673:89"/>2. Jeſus Chriſt is the very powerfull corroſive. I is only he that muſt let the wound be ranſaked to the bottom: I mean, he only doth give in light to ſee into the bottom of the wound; It is only he that muſt eat out all the corrupt matter, unleſs you can think that ſin can be killed without the application of the power of the death of Jeſus Chriſt, and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is Chriſt dead in vain.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is impoſſible that any ſoul ſhould too ſoon anſwer the call of God. Now obſerve, the Lord calls thy ſoul, whatever thou art, at this moment to apply Jeſus Chriſt tendered. Saith God, Thou poor rebell and traytor to the Crown of Heaven, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee to receive the Lord Jeſus; It is my will thou ſhouldſt receive Jeſus Chriſt as a Mediator, to make up a union between thy ſelf and me. Now doſt think thou canſt anſwer too ſoon to this call? You read of the five fooliſh Virgins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. That for want of being ready preſently to hear and anſwer, when the Bridegroom ſhould come, they were ſhut out, and could never enter into the Bridegrooms Chamber, to have Communion with Jeſus Chriſt. You read alſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.7. That when the King invited the people to the Marriage of his Son (that is the Lord Jeſus) becauſe they neglected that call, the King was exceeding wrath.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A ſoul can never too ſoon come into a capable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of doing any thing that may be acceptable to God. God calls for prayer at thy hand this night; doſt think it is too ſoon to be in a poſture wherein thy prayer may be heard? Is it too ſoon to come from under the hatred of God, to be in a ſtate of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and love? It is more clear than the Sun at noon day, that it is a curſed principle of darkneſs, that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48673:90"/>
the ſoul ſhould take heed that it doth not too ſoon apply to himſelf the Lord Jeſus tendered.</p>
               <p>But though this be a principle of darkneſs, yet by ſome Hell-bred Deviliſh Policy, the Devil can improve it both ways; for though he caſt in this principle to hinder ſouls from coming to Chriſt; yet on the contrary he perſwades ſome in a confuſed, diſorderly way, to apply, in ſome kind, the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus too too ſoon. And therefore there are two or three things to be anexed to this principle of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though the Lord Jeſus cannot be applyed to the ſoul too ſoon, yet it is dangerous and deſtructive to many ſouls, that they do believe their own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt too ſoon. They do fancy to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that though they be vile Sinners, yet the Lord Jeſus is a Saviour, and they hope to be ſaved by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. This indeed is the common principle that the Devil uſeth as his grand ſnare wherein he catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth many ſouls. Now there are two ways whereby ſouls may conceive dangerouſly, and deſtructively, their own ſalvation by Chriſt too ſoon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When they conceive they ſhall certainly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain heaven and glory by Jeſus Chriſt, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an eye or reſpect to any other benefit by Chriſt. Now indeed doth the ſoul conceit his ſalvation by Chriſt too ſoon, when it neglects all the benefits that are propounded by Jeſus Chriſt, and neglects the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the manner how Jeſus Chriſt is propounded, and confuſedly looketh unto the end alone, which is heaven and glory, and fancies to himſelf that he ſhall attain theſe by him. Though indeed the eye of the ſouls faith may be fixed upon one particular benefit that is propounded in Jeſus Chriſt, in order of nature,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48673:90"/>
before his eye is fixed upon another benefit, and thereupon it is truly ſaid, that Jeſus Chriſt as he is a Saviour, and as he ſaves, is the primary object of faith, that is, the very firſt object of the firſt acting of the ſouls Faith; yet this is ſtill but only in order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not in order of time. That is thus, the ſoul cannot rightly have his eye of faith upon one bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to be attained by Jeſus Chriſt, but he muſt have his eye upon all other benefits alſo propounded in Jeſus Chriſt, that are ſutable to his poor needy ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſoul conceiteth his ſalvation by Chriſt too ſoon, when he conceives that he ſhall attain Heaven, by Chriſt, without looking for any thing to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by Chriſt upon the ſoul, That's the reaſon why nothing can daſh in ſunder their confidence and hope, though their conſciences tell them, their nature is the ſame, and their practice the ſame that ever it was. Yet you muſt conceive, it is only herein that this conceiting ſalvation by Chriſt is ſaid to be too ſoon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that it is prepoſterous. It is a drawing Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion without Premiſes, that is without any thing to draw the concluſion upon. Then a ſoul conceiveth right<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, when he conceiveth firſt it is Gods will that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould mediate between God and his ſoul, and take away all the cauſe of offence and diſpleaſure; and then the ſoul concludes, therefore I muſt needs be ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If this conceit of the ſouls ſalvation by Chriſt, doth ariſe from the ſouls giving credit to any word of God, upon which he doth build this conceit, then it is only ſaid to be too ſoon in regard of order, that is, in regard of order of nature, for indeed as for
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48673:91"/>
order of time, this giving credit to ſuch a word of God, as holds forth ſalvation to him by Chriſt, might and ought to have been at the ſame time, at the giving credit to the other word of God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing his union to be effected by the father through Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obſerve, That this conceiting their Salvation by Chriſt, is no application of Chriſt to their own Souls, tendered or offered as a Saviour by God. A Soul may conceit Salvation by Chriſt, and yet never receive him as a Saviour: And that will appear in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God offers the Lord Jeſus as a compleat Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>He is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, all that come unto God by him.</hi> To the <hi>[uttermoſt]</hi> even unto perfection, that is, to ſave them exactly in all things, from all evils, and from all fears and dangers that can poſſibly accrue. Now he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiteth not that the Lord Jeſus ſhould ſave him from all kind of evils, guilt, and miſery that his Soul is caſt into; doth not conceit Jeſus Chriſt to be his compleat Saviour, and ſo applys Chriſt too ſoon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Salvation that God tenders by Jeſus Chriſt, when he tenders him as a Saviour, is two-fold.</p>
               <p>Firſt, From the guilt of ſin. That is, the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and redeeming the Soul from his obligation unto puniſhment. Now this Salvation in Scripture is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led reconciliation; which is the removing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of God, that ſhould bind it over to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment, and bring the Soul into a ſtate of amity, and unity, and love to God. And this is the primary cauſe why Chriſt received his name, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.21. <hi>His name ſhall be called Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:48673:91"/>Secondly, God tenders by Chriſt to ſave Souls from the pollution of ſin. So that the Soul that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies Chriſt rightly as a Saviour, applies him thus; He ſees the Lord tenders the Lord Chriſt as one that hath triumphed over ſin, and obtained a glorious conqueſt over Hell and Death; and then he ſeeth the Lord inviting his Soul to receive the Lord Jeſus, that he might be partaker of the conqueſt; and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his heart cloſes with the tender, and gives cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to it.</p>
               <p>There is a Seventh Principle of Darkneſs, and that is this, That the Lord Chriſt muſt not be applied to the Soul too much in a way of comfort.<note place="margin">Principle of Darkneſs.</note> It is commonly received by many, that comfort is more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the Soul to meddle with, than lying under horrour and terrour ſtill. They commonly illuſtrate it by this ſimilitude; ſay they, ſome drops of <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitae</hi> may be exceeding helpful to a poor fainting ſpirit, it may revive a man in a ſwoun; but pouring in of much may overcome a man, and choak the natural vital heat, and ſo indangers a mans life: juſt thus, ſay they, it is with the Soul, when the heart is ſinking and fainting, and preſt down through fears of the anger and diſpleaſure of God againſt him for ſin, it may be good for the Soul to have ſome drops of the precious water flowing down from the boſom of Jeſus Chriſt, but, ſay they, if you pour in too much, you may indanger the Souls life to eternity. This is another Hell-bred principle to prevent the Souls ſight of Union with Chriſt. There are two grounds of this principle.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the applying the Lord Jeſus too much for comforting the Soul, may make the ſoul pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48673:92"/>
Thus they prove it. Say they, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the Law too much to the ſoul, and opening the terrible Wrath and Indignation of God too much, may make the ſoul deſpair: ſo on the contrary, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening and applying the glorious Priviledges of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt for the comforting the ſoul too much, may put it upon a deſperate Rock of Preſumption.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a ſecond ground is this, that the apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord Jeſus for the comforting of the ſoul too much, will too ſoon dry up the Penitent Tears, it will ſoon ſeal up the Springs of Sorrow and Mourning that were broken up in the ſoul. Now for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this to be a Principle of Darkneſs, there is firſt ſomething to be premiſed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the ſoul underſtand what is meant by comfort.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What is meant by applying comfort to the ſoul. By comfort is meant only that ſtrength, and that Life and Refreſhment that a ſoul receiveth from the apprehenſion of the good of any object. And to apply the Lord Jeſus for comfort the ſoul, is to receive the Lord Jeſus with all his Glorious Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges that are ſutable for the Poor, Needy, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable, Loveleſs ſoul, according as God the Father tenders him to the ſoul. To ſpeak more plainly, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Lord Jeſus as he is offered freely to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by God to the Poor Deſpicable ſoul, to make up a League, and Amity and Love between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the ſoul, to break in ſunder thoſe Chains wherewith the ſoul was clogged by Sin to everlaſting Deſtruction, and in a word, for the perfecting of the ſouls Happineſs, both here and for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:48673:92"/>Now I ſhall anſwer directly to that firſt Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon which this firſt Principle of Darkneſs is built. And I ſay it is impoſſible that the applying of the Lord Jeſus for the comforting of the ſoul, ſhould make the ſoul in danger to miſcarry through Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, but rather the contrary, it is the greateſt preſervative againſt Preſumption. And that will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in three or four particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In regard the more the comforts of the ſoul are enlarged through the application of Chriſt, the more clear is that curſed Root of Self-Confidence, rooted out of the Heart. The Comforts of Jeſus Chriſts, in their own nature, do empty the ſoul of it ſelf and all Self-Confidence, in regard it removes the ſoul from all imaginary dependance upon its ſelf, either for Comfort here, or for Mercy and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Eternity. The ſouls perfect nothingneſs in it ſelf, is only by beholding the Lord Jeſus as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given him to the ſoul: Therefore it is ſaid in 1 <hi>John.</hi> 3.2, 3. <hi>We know not yet what we ſhall be, but then we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall know him as he is:</hi> And <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.19. <hi>The Apoſtle prays that they may comprehend with all Saints, what is the Height, and Bredth, and Length, and Depth of the Love of God, which paſſeth knowledge:</hi> That is, to know this to their own ſouls; And what is the end of all? That they may be filled with the fulneſs of God. This fulneſs of God can be wrought by nothing, but by the full comprehenſion of Jeſus Chriſt, and all his Comforts.</p>
               <p n="2">II. In regard it raiſeth the ſouls thoughts of Jeſus Chriſt in a tranſcendent manner, and fills the Heart with a high eſtimation of him. When the ſoul ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies moſt incomprehenſively the Lord Jeſus in all his
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48673:93"/>
Priviledges, for the refreſhing of his ſoul, then doth the ſoul ſee moſt largly into the Incomprehenſive Gulf of the excellency of Jeſus Chriſt; and when the ſoul ſeeth Jeſus Chriſt moſt clearly, as altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible, then is the Heart filled with the higheſt thoughts that can be of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The application of the Lord Jeſus for the comforting of the ſoul in the largeſt manner that can be, doth beget a more precious fear in the heart, than all the Terrours, Sights, and Viſions of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of God againſt the ſoul for Sin can poſſibly beget. All the Reaſon that can be given, why it ſhould endanger the ſoul to Preſume, is only this, that the applying Chriſt in two large a meaſure in his comforts, ſhould make the ſoul without fear: Now the ſoul is never ſo filled with Holy Fear, as when it hath the largeſt comprehenſion of Jeſus Chriſt; The Reaſon is plain, The larger comprehenſion the ſoul hath of Jeſus Chriſt, the more natural is the love to Jeſus Chriſt: Now love is extended upon Jeſus Chriſt, when it reſts upon him, or fetcheth in Joy through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiving: And according as love is extended, ſo is fear extended; Love and Fear go hand in hand, you cannot divide them; a man of large love is a man of large fear, The reaſon is plain, The more dear any object is to the ſoul, the more a man feareth to loſe it:</p>
               <p n="4">IIII. When the Lord Chriſt is applied moſt for Comfort, then doth a Holy Jealouſie riſe high in the heart. When Love riſes high, Jealouſie riſes high: Jealouſie is compounded of Love and Anger, or Love and Hatred. Where Love runs out largely in Zeal, there is a Zeal of Hatred againſt all that ſhould deprive us of it. Put a Fearful man and a Jealous man
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48673:93"/>
together, to Watch over a Beloved object, and you need not fear their Sleeping; Thus Fear and Jealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie meeting together in the ſoul, will make it Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful leaſt there ſhould be the leaſt outgoing of the Heart from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Neither can it dry up the Repenting or Penitent Tears too ſoon. It is as impoſſible that the Springs of Godly Sorrow ſhould be ſealed up, by the application of the Lord Jeſus in the largeſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for the comforting of the ſoul, as it is impoſſible it ſhould make the ſoul Preſume. The Foundation of this Principle of Darkneſs is laid upon a two-fold miſtake.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the diſcerning eye of the ſoul, whereby Sin ſhould be diſcerned, ſhould be cloſed up with the ſight of the apprehenſion of large comfort from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the ſight or apprehenſion of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of comfort in the Lord Jeſus for his ſoul for the preſent, ſhould be the Original of true Godly Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and ſo that Godly Sorrow ſhould Periſh, when the comforts of the Lord Jeſus, ſutable to his needy ſoul, appear. Now it is apparent that the eye of the ſoul whereby he may ſee his own Wretchedneſs, Merit, and Deſert, is more clear by the ſight of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged comfort from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The eye of the ſoul receiveth more Divine light to diſcover Sin in the nature of it, by how much in a greater degree the ſoul apprehends enlarged com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, through the application of the Lord Jeſus. This is that precious eye-ſalve ſpoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. that Chriſt inviteth ſouls to come and buy of him. That's the reaſon <hi>Mary</hi> wept ſo much, and waſhed the feet of Jeſus Chriſt with her tears; Chriſt tells
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48673:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you, it was becauſe ſhe loved much; And what was the cauſe of that love, but only the apprehenſion of the glorious priviledges to her in Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The apprehenſion of a defect of comfort in the Lord Chriſt, ſutable to the Soul for the preſent, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a ſpring or head from whence the ſtream of Godly ſorrow flows. Godly ſorrow muſt ariſe from the cleareſt, moſt ſpiritual, ſin: Now you ſee, the cleareſt diſcerning of ſin in a Spiritual manner, doth ariſe from the clear diſcerning of thoſe enlarged com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, through the application of the Lord Jeſus; And indeed as thoſe increaſe, ſo doth Godly ſorrow increaſe; The greateſt comforted Soul, is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt mourning Soul. Now you ſee the foundation is too weak to bear up this principle, and alſo that it will appear to be a principle of darkneſs. There can be but two ſenſes in which this propoſition can be taken.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It muſt either be meant thus, That the Lord Chriſt muſt not be applyed for comforting of Souls too much, that is, not applyed to comfort the Soul in his neceſſity with two great a confidence. Now there it croſſes the precious heavenly light that ſhines from the Sun of righteouſneſs, the Lord Chriſt, in regard it is the great command that the Soul ought to receive him whole, with all his priviledges propounded to the Soul, with a full aſſurance of faith: And ſo <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith is commended, that he did not doubt at all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p>Or, Secondly, the application of the Lord Chriſt for comforting the Soul too much, muſt be meant thus, That he may be applyed too confidently to the Soul, with too large a comprehenſion of the infinite riches of all excellencies that are treaſured up for
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48673:94"/>
the Soul in the Lord Jeſus. Now to apply the Lord Jeſus for comfort too much this way, doth alſo direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſe the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is commonly the frequent prayer of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle for the Saints, that they might have the fulleſt comprehenſion of Jeſus Chriſt to their Souls, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17, 18. He prays that their <hi>underſtandings may be enlightned, that they may know what is the hope of his calling:</hi> that is, <hi>that they might know the glorious things that they are called to, in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.18. He would have them <hi>know the exceeding riches of his grace to them that believe.</hi> He would have them comprehend the dimenſions of the love of Chriſt to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is the deſire of Jeſus Chriſt, that all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might have fulneſs of joy, <hi>John</hi> 15.11. <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, that your joy might be full.</hi> That's alſo the Apoſtles prayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. <hi>The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that you may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is according to the degree wherein the Soul comprehends the excellency treaſured up in Jeſus Chriſt for his Soul, that it partaketh of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Chriſt, and is changed into the the likeneſs of Chriſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. So that it is a principle of darkneſs, that clearly contradicts the word of truth, to ſay, the Soul muſt not apply the Lord Jeſus too much, that is, with too large a comprehenſion of the priviledges of Jeſus Chriſt to his Soul.</p>
               <p>But there are two things to be opened about this, for the clearing of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though Jeſus Chriſt cannot be applyed for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting the Soul too much, be the Soul in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48673:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it can be, yet the Lord Chriſt may be looked into for comforting a Soul too much: That is, when Souls look upon Jeſus Chriſt for comfort without receiving him as he is tendered by God to the Soul. Though Chriſt be the object of all true comfort to the Soul, yet it is Chriſt as he is in Union with the Soul; for it is not the goodneſs of an object, ſimply and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely conſidered, that doth ſend down ſtrength and life into the heart in beholding of it, but it is the goodneſs of an object appropriated to its ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Jeſus Chriſt may be applyed by others, for comforting their Souls too much. I mean, to affirm to any particular Soul, that the Lord Jeſus with his glorious priviledges is his; this is applying Jeſus Chriſt for comforting them too much; the reaſon is plain, in regard it is out of Gods way. Though theſe two Cautions are to be obſerved, yet it is a principle of darkneſs that is neceſſary to be removed, before there can be a certain evidence of the Souls U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There is one Principle of darkneſs more, and that is this, That a Soul muſt diſcern his peculiar right to,<note place="margin">Principle of Darkneſs.</note> and intereſt in the particular promiſe, before he believe it is the will of God to receive his particular Soul into Union with Chriſt. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Soul is this, that he muſt behold ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe paſs'd over to him by Jeſus Chriſt, before he can believe it is the will of God to receive him into Union with Chriſt. This principle being ſo cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forged in Hell, that it is ſcarce diſcerned from a principle of light, we ſhall endeavour to help you to diſcern it to be a principle of darkneſs. I find three foundations upon which this principle is built.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:48673:95"/>1. That it cannot poſſibly be lawfull for every Soul to believe, that it is the will of God to take him into union with Chriſt. For ſaith the Soul, then the greateſt part of the world ſhould be put upon it to believe a lie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it muſt be through a Souls right to ſome promiſe, that he cometh to have a right to Jeſus Chriſt. Now this is a falſe foundation, becauſe there can be no intereſt, nor right the Soul can have to one promiſe of God, before the Soul is bound to believe that the Lord will receive his ſoul into Union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard the firſt promiſe is Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the very primary object of faith is Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. This you ſhall obſerve, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. The firſt promiſe that was given to <hi>Adam</hi> was, <hi>that the ſeed of the woman ſhould break the ſerpents head,</hi> which is nothing but a promiſe of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the promiſe was firſt renewed to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> it was in theſe words; <hi>In thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed:</hi> What is that ſeed? It is Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. So the Apoſtles in their preaching laid Jeſus Chriſt as the firſt object of faith, Believe in the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third foundation of this principle is this, That only thoſe promiſes that are made unto holy quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualities in ſanctified Souls, are aſſuring promiſes, or promiſes that can aſſure unto a Souls faith, that the Lord will receive him into union with Chriſt. Saith the Soul, there are inviting promiſes and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring promiſes; now inviting promiſes ſpeak ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as none can diſcern his union from thence; but the promiſes to the graces they in a manner particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larize Souls: Now hence the Soul concludeth thus, it muſt of neceſſity be a neceſſary precedent before a
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48673:96"/>
Souls aſſurance that God will take him into union with Chriſt, that he ſee ſome holy quality in his own ſpirit, to which the Lord hath made ſome ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, Now obſerve the groſs darkneſs and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in conceiving inviting promiſes not to be able to give aſſurance to a Souls faith, of union with Chriſt. It will appear in two or three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then the Soul muſt conceive, that thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that the Lord propounds, in the inviting of the Soul to Chriſt, may not be believed with a fulneſs of confidence and aſſurance. Now</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thence the Soul muſt conceive, that ſome por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the word of God, have not ſufficient authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be believed undoubtedly by the Soul. Now what an high indignity is offered to God, in enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſuch a thought, that any one <hi>Iota</hi> or Tittle from the great God ſhould not be able to command a fulneſs of belief from every ſoul?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Soul maketh all theſe inviting promiſes to be meerly in vain. For if theſe inviting promiſes do not ſufficiently reveal the Lords will, to receive a poor loveleſs Soul, that hath been at enmity, to union with the Lord Jeſus, ſo as to make the Soul believe it with firmneſs of confidence, then they are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether uſeleſs, they can be no incentive and motive to invite the Soul to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Soul muſt ſay thus, That thoſe inviting promiſes may not lawfully be applyed particularly unto particular Souls with that fulneſs of confidence. Now herein is great injury done to the truth, as will appear in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Soul muſt deny thoſe portions of the word to be believed by any one Soul under heaven. Now herein the Soul ſhews much impudence and boldneſs,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48673:96"/>
to ſet limits to the will of God, where he is pleaſed to ſet no limits.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then thoſe inviting promiſes ſhould not be the object of juſtifying faith, according as it doth juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. For queſtionleſs that which is called juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, (according as it doth juſtifie, or in the exerciſe of it in that juſtifying way) that doth particularly apply thoſe promiſes to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Soul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is one imagination more of the Soul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which it grounds this conceit, that the inviting promiſes of God, are no grounds of aſſuring the Soul of union with Chriſt, and that is this, That a Soul may with a fulneſs of aſſurance, believe the Lords will to be, to receive his particular Soul into Union with Jeſus Chriſt, and yet the Soul at the ſame time be doubtfull and queſtioning of his Union. All that is poſſible for the Soul to ſay in this, is only thus much, that a Soul may believe with all fulneſs of aſſurance, the Lords will to take the Soul into Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt habitually, though not actually, and ſo be queſtioning his Union with Chriſt, though he do believe it habitually. But alas this comes nothing to the purpoſe, for indeed though it may be ſaid truly, that a Soul hath the habit of faith, to believe it is the will of God to take Souls into union with Chriſt, yet a Soul cannot be ſaid properly habitually to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, for indeed the weakeſt believers, that have the loweſt degree of faith, have the act of faith from whence this habit of faith proceeds, and ſo he doth in ſome degree believe the Lords will to receive his Soul into union with Jeſus Chriſt in the promiſes. Thus I have done with the firſt kind of beams the Devil forges to caſt into the Souls eye.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:48673:97"/>There is a ſecond kind of Beams of Darkneſs, and thoſe are Dark Diſtempers. Though the Devils grand policy be to keep falſe principles in the ſouls judgment, whereby the ſoul may diſcern all in a falſe way that God propounds to him, yet he hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther policy to flee to, and that is Diſtempers in the Heart. Now theſe are alſo dangerous, and keep the ſoul from aſſurance of union with Chriſt, while thoſe remain in the ſoul. Therefore that is a ſecond work of the ſpirit to pluck out thoſe dark diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; And theſe are alſo divers.</p>
               <p>The firſt Dark Diſtemper is Spiritual Pride. It is Natural Pride working Spiritually, though ſometimes it is Spiritual Pride:<note place="margin">Dark Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</note> And that is a kind of humor, or ſwelling in the Spirit; Or it is a kind of lifting up the ſpirit in a croſſneſs, and averſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the will of God. This the Devil cauſeth to grow like a wen upon the ſouls ſpiritual eye, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he prevents the ſouls ſeeing what the promiſe holds forth to him. There are two ſpecial workings of this diſtemper, whereby the ſoul is prevented from diſcerning what the promiſe holds ſorth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It inclineth the ſoul to have his thoughts taken up chiefly in looking after, and ſeeking out ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and goodneſs in the ſoul it ſelf, whereupon it might ſtay its ſoul, and uphold its ſinking ſpirit. And hence you ſhall obſerve (though the heart little mind it, and think it ſelf far enough off from pride) the ſouls eye is always upon his own prayers, and duties of worſhip, upon his own tears, mourning and groaning, upon the deſires of his own heart, and its workings toward God, upon his own hungering and thirſting after God; And all the ſoul complains of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48673:97"/>
under this diſtemper is commonly (that which a ſoul would little think proceeds from pride) that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find any goodneſs in himſelf: Whereas if the truth be found out, and the heart ſearched to the bottom, he thinketh he hath much goodneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It maketh the heart averſe to the thoughts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving all that ever he ſhall have, only through meer gift alone. The proud heart will not be beholding to God in Chriſt for all, but would have all in his own way. Hence ariſeth a three-ſold diſtemper.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſoul inſnarles it ſelf in the interpretation of the promiſes, and interprets all the promiſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it ſelf. Thence the ſouls thinks concerning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very promiſe, it is but given to aggravate my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence ariſeth a concluſion in the ſoul that it muſt not, nay ſometimes that it will not receive the Lord Jeſus, till it find ſuch and ſuch diſpoſitions, as the ſoul conceives neceſſary to be in it ſelf. Saith the ſoul, if I could find my heart enlarged towards God, and my deadneſs and coldneſs removed, if I could find a mighty fervency of the ſpirit of prayer in my heart, I could think indeed that the promiſe of the Lord Jeſus might belong to me: So that here the ſoul ſits waiting for, and purſuing after ſomething that he might bring with him to the Lord Chriſt, that he might come with his peny, to take his peny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth of that which God propounds in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From this averſneſs to receive all from free grace, ariſeth a neglect and diſregard, of ſearching into the promiſes what they hold forth. Propound the promiſes to the ſoul, alas, ſaith the ſoul, what is this to me, none of theſe promiſes belong to me? Now thence the ſoul is kept in his dolefull blindneſs
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48673:98"/>
and darkneſs, through want of gazing upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and looking upon the beam of light it holds forth.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Diſtemper is the raſhneſs and unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſoul. This raſhneſs is an unadviſed ſudden drawing up determinations concerning the ſouls condition,<note place="margin">Dark Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</note> without a due exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the ground from whence the ſoul draws that determination, and without a due weighing of thoſe concluſions drawn from thence in the ballance of the Sanctuary. Queſtionleſs this is none of the leaſt diſtempers, nor none of the leaſt beams that the Devil keeps in the ſouls eye: It is one of the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret dangerous ſnares, that the Devil catches the feet of ſouls in, to put them upon looking on the things of God out of a rational way. I know no greater difference between true faith, and the hypocrites temporary faith, the one believes in a rational way by his judgment, when the other have confuſed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards God without judgment. Now for the further clearing of this diſtemper of ſpirit,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Saith the ſoul (through this raſh diſtemper prevailing in his heart) thoſe to whom the promiſes of God are intended to be made good, God draws them to embrace them, but I do not find that God draws me, or giveth me power, therefore I am none to whom this promiſe is made. The principle is true, but the concluſion is drawn raſhly from it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſoul commonly draws this concluſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out weighing what the drawings of God are, and what the ſecret power infuſed into the ſoul, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thoſe promiſes tendered to it, is. I have heard a ſoul draw this concluſion from this principle, but
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48673:98"/>
when asked what are the drawings of God in the ſoul, to inable it to embrace Jeſus Chriſt tendered in the promiſe, the ſoul knows not: Ask it, didſt ever find the Lord making thy heart willing to receive the Lord Jeſus to be one with thy ſoul, and to make up an union with the father for thee? O yes, ſaith the ſoul, I confeſs my ſoul longs for that, I cannot but ſay I am willing: And yet in the mean time, through the diſtemper of raſhneſs, draws this concluſion that he is none of the number of thoſe to whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made, becauſe God does not draw him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Suppoſe there was not this willingneſs, yet the concluſion is raſhly drawn from the principle, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard there is no time that God hath limited, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to himſelf, wherein he will draw the hearts of thoſe that he intends the promiſes for.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſouls ground is falſe, in regard the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture determines not, that the Lord always acts thoſe inward habitual drawings of his, when he hath once actually drawn.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Say ſome ſouls, through this raſh diſtemper, that thoſe God intends good to, he will not ſuffer them to grow worſe and worſe under the means, and to decay in their affections and grow more corrupt: But ſaith the ſoul, I grow worſe and worſe under the means, more corrupt, and my affections decay, and therefore I am afraid the Lord never intends to do good to me. Now I pray obſerve but thine own raſhneſs, in not weighing and trying and ſearching all things, to ſearch whether indeed thou beeſt grown worſe and worſe under the means or no; and to ſee in what degree thou art grown more corrupt, and whether it be ſuch a degree as the Scripture evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denceth, God lets not thoſe that he intends good to in
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48673:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Chriſt to fall into ſin or no. Here ſhould have been a great many things weighed, before thou hadſt drawn that concluſion.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Thou ſhouldeſt have weighed, whether thine heart be grown more corrupt or no. Divers things things are conſiderable there.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though thou judgeſt thy ſelf more corrupt, yet thou mayſt not truly have more corruption than thou hadſt: A ſoul is to diſtinguiſh between corruptions that are effectively ſo, and thoſe that are formally ſo: It may be thou mayſt ſee corruptions formally in thy ſoul more than before, whereas thou mayſt not be more corrupt effectively: I mean thus, thou mayſt find more motions unto ſin and wickedneſs than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and yet not thoſe motions prevail to ſin ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectively, that is, to deprave and corrupt thy ſoul. Though indeed interpretatively, and according to the ſtrict law of God, thoſe ſtirrings of corruption may be called ſin, yet they cannot properly be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed corruption, and thou canſt not be ſaid to be more and more corrupt; for then they grow corruptions, when the heart is inclined to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thou mayſt judge thy ſelf to have more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and yet there may not be more corruption neither.</p>
               <p>Firſt, God may have caſt more light into thy ſoul than before, when thou didſt judge thy ſelf not to be ſo full of corruption. Now through light every iniquity hath a greater weight upon the ſpirit than it had formerly: Now the more weight it hath upon the ſpirit, the more it is taken notice of. And through more light there is a clearer diſcovery of the duty that the Lord requireth of the ſoul, and of the nature and ſpirituality of the duty: Now the more
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48673:99"/>
exquiſitly the ſoul diſcerns the duty God requireth at his hand, the more abominable he ſeeth his own heart.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if there be not more light, it may be there is a greater tenderneſs of ſpirit infuſed into thee than formerly. So that thou feeleſt corruptions more, becauſe the burden of them is more ſpiritually upon thy heart than before, and ſo they appear to be the greater to thee.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Corruptions may appear more, when they are not more, in regard there may be many occaſions of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to draw forth inherent corruption into exerciſe. There might be as many legions of iniquity in thy heart formerly, though they did not appear, becauſe they had not the ſame occaſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Satan may be ſuffered by God to endeavour to draw out corruption, for the diſcovery of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the mortifying of it. The Lord may ſuffer Satan (contrary to his intentions) to war againſt his own kingdom in thy heart, in drawing out all his power to ſtir thy corruptions, that thou mayſt go to heaven for power to ſlay them. So that if all theſe things were well conſidered, it may be, the heart would not be found to be more corrupt.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Suppoſe the heart ſhould be grown more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt under means for a ſeaſon. Suppoſe the root of ſin ſhould get ſome ſap, and bud and ſprout again, and ſend forth its branches more plentifully, and bring forth more fruit; yet it were to be weighed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſoul draws ſuch a concluſion, whether ſin may not revive again, and grow more lively for a time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in thoſe who are near to the heart of God, to whom God intends all the good in the promiſes ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:48673:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>III. It would be alſo conſidered, whether the Scripture warrants the drawing ſuch a concluſion, from a real ſenſe of growing worſe and worſe. It would be conſidered, whether the Lord be not ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to at that time, that thou mighteſt receive ſuch influences of grace from him, as might prevent thy ſoul from ſtill growing worſe and worſe.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. It would be conſidered, whether the ſoul can find that ſuch a degree of declenſion, as it is now fallen into, be ſuch a one as the Lord Chriſt hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all that fall into it, from receiving himſelf in the Covenant of Free Grace, If I ſhould follow up this raſhneſs of the ſoul further, I might open that the ſouls real declenſion in affections that were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, may not be a ſufficient ground to conclude that the ſoul is grown worſe and worſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It would be conſidered, whether affections did work in the Lords own orderly way, through the following of the judgment, in cloſing with the truth propounded in Chriſt. It may be the novelty of the truths affected thy heart, as being new things, and it was not from the dictate of thy judgment, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the excellency of Jeſus Chriſt tendered, that thy affections did work ſo powerfully.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It would be conſidered, whether the Lord may not, and doth not more frequently, ſtir up higher affections in ſouls in the firſt holding forth of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to them, than he always intends afterwards to them. Do you think that the Prodigal (<hi>Luke</hi> 15.44.) had always thoſe expreſſions of his fathers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in his return, that he had when he firſt return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Then there muſt be the beſt robe put upon him, and a feaſt, and muſick: But it is a queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his father put him on ſuch apparel every day,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48673:100"/>
and make him a feaſt every day? So the Lord may, and I believe doth, at the firſt revealing of his truth, give more affections than he intends to continue, and more ſtirrings of grace infuſed than he intends after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conſtantly to continue: yet though there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main not the ſame activity, vivacity, livelineſs of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, yet there may be the ſame affection remain; nay, it may be the affection may be grown in its fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and ſteadineſs, and in its orderly way of working towards Jeſus Chriſt, though it appear not working ſo powerfully and mightily as it did before. You ſee plainly the concluſion is raſhly drawn, though from a true principle conſidered in ſome ſenſe.</p>
               <p>A third Diſtemper is fearfulneſs, the timerous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the ſoul.<note place="margin">Dark Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</note> Now you muſt rightly underſtand this diſtemper, for though the Devil caſt in the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of fearfulneſs into ſome ſouls to keep them from union with Chriſt, yet he caſts in the diſtemper of preſumption into more ſouls, to prevent them from ſeeing the face of God in the glaſs of the Goſpel, and ſo leads their ſouls into the pit of darkneſs. We ſhall clear it in two or three concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There cannot be too much holy fear poſſeſſing any heart. That is, there cannot be too much awfull reverence of the holy Majeſty of God, nor too much awfull reſpect of God, as he preſents himſelf cloathed with the precious robe of mercy &amp; loving kindneſs &amp; goodneſs. This fear God requires, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 130.4. <hi>There is forgiveneſs with thee, that thou mayſt be feared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a fear which is a terrour and dread and horrour of the avenging juſtice of the Almighty God. There is a fear of diſpleaſing this God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in this manner, leaſt his anger ſhould be ſo
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48673:101"/>
kindled, that flames of indignation ſhould proceed from him, to the conſuming of ſoul and body for ever. And it is this fear that is too much in the ſouls of Gods dear ones. This kind of fear is but a <hi>Judas</hi> his fear, and a <hi>Cain</hi>'s fear, and a <hi>Saul</hi>'s fear.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a natural affection of fear that poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the hearts of men and women, as men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. That's this, a perturbation, or a troubling, or perplexing, or cauſing the heart to ſuffer, through the motions of the blood and animal ſpirits to and fro, upon the ſouls apprehending ſome evil that he is in danger to ſuffer. This kind of fear is not an evil fear abſolutely conſidered: But this fear becomes a ſinfull diſtemper through the inordinateneſs of it. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. When it exceeds the bounds of reaſon. That is, when the heart is perplexed with ſome evil he ſhall ſuffer, and can give no ground of this fear: The ſoul is afraid of the loſs of heaven, and the glorious pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges tendered in Chriſt, and can render no good account according to reaſon, why his ſoul is thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When it exceeds the bounds of Grace. That is, when it exceeds the bounds God hath appointed in his word, when it proves a diſtracting fear, and unfits the ſoul for the duty God requires at his hand. And this diſtemper ariſes from three principles, and accordingly produces three effects, whereby the ſoul is prevented from diſcerning the light the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe holds forth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Commonly it ariſes from the ſenſe of the ſouls own guiltineſs. The ſenſe of a ſoul to be a guilty perſon, naturally ſtirs up fear of puniſhment, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diſpoſition of men as men; and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with natural conſcience it ſtirs up fear of divine
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48673:101"/>
vengeance hereafter, and ſo by this means that ſinful fear prevails and clouds the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ariſeth from the ſouls apprehenſion of the height of the conſequence, of the ſouls right eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment. Fear is begotten by looking upon the danger: It is like a man ſtanding upon a high Tower, and looking upon the downfall, though he ſtands firm, it pales the man, and makes him afraid: So they ſtanding upon the Tower of Eternity come to be ſenſible of the great danger, and thence ariſes this fear of heart.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This fear ariſeth from the darkneſs and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance wherein the ſoul remains. I mean his ignorance of the way of the right eſtabliſhment of the ſoul, his ignorance of the nature and large extent of thoſe promiſes that God vouchſafes to his ſoul: Like a blind man that is in continual fear leſt he meet with danger, and ſtumble and fall. Walking in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſtrikes a fear naturally in any perſon, much more doth this ſpiritual darkneſs produce fear in the ſoul. Now this darkneſs thus riſen hath three effects to prevent the ſoul from the ſight of the promiſe held forth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It cauſeth the ſoul to create ſtrange unheard of dangers to himſelf, through the ſtrength of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination working by fear. The very ſtrength of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, when this diſtemper of fear prevails, cauſeth the ſoul to make new dangers to it ſelf every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to fear where no fear is: And thence he multiplies one objection upon another, and the anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wering of one objection is but the bringing in of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther objection.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This diſtemper of fearfulneſs, doth prevent the ſouls right uſe of the appointed means for the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48673:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Prevention of real danger diſcovered. The ſoul thinking to eſcape preſumption, by receiving Jeſus Chriſt, leſt it have no right to him, prevents it ſelf of the uſe of the right means to come to Chriſt, it makes the ſoul mindleſs of what the promiſe holds forth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This diſtemper darkens the reaſon of the ſoul, and clouds the precious divine light that God hath infuſed into it. It looks upon God in Chriſt through the dark glaſs of fear, and ſo is driven from God in Chriſt, rather then drawn to a cloſe with fuller con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. Now there are two things the ſpirit of God is to do for the removing of this diſtemper.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Spirit of God preſents the Lord in his love, compaſſions, and tender nature, cloathed with the nature of loving-kindneſs, and thereupon begins to allay that paſſion of fear, to prevent the rage and dominion of it. The ſpirit preſents the Lord as it were, coming down with a ſtill gentle voice, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſoul in a precious alluring, ſoul-conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, heart-inamouring way, and thereby the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to have diſpoſitions begotten in it to cloſe with God, to draw near to God, whereas it ſtood before afar off afrighted and aſtoniſhed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſpirit uſeth to expoſtulate with the poor trembling ſoul, about the cauſe of his fear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of heart. The ſpirit cometh and expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth with the ſoul, why art thou ſo afraid thou trembling ſoul? why doſt ſtand ſhaking like a leaf in the foreſt ſhaken with the wind? why is thy heart ſo perplexed? Saith the ſpirit, Chriſt will receive thee if thou beeſt willing to receive Then it may be, the paſſion of fear is allayed, and the ſoul brought to cloſe with the tender of love in Jeſus Chriſt, and the ſoul is brought to a holy fear and trembling,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48673:102"/>
laying his mouth in the duſt before God, thinking himſelf worthy to go into the pit of wo for ever, yet yielding to receive what the Lord propounds in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>A fourth Diſtemper is <hi>Over much Jealouſie,</hi> Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of God, and Jealouſie of his own heart.<note place="margin">Dark Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</note> The ſoul is exceeding prone out of meaſure, to a ſtrange unheard of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of God, to have evil ſurmiſings of God. Look to ſome prophane ones,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They have ſuch evil ſurmiſings, as they ſuſpect God in his being, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1. <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart, there is no God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. A Second ſort ſurmiſe that God regards not the commiſſion of ſin ſo as others would perſwade them. Like thoſe <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50, 21. that think the Lord to be ſuch a one as themſelves, they think there need be no ſuch ſtrictneſs to go to heaven as others would make toem believe: That's the meaning of that, thou thoughteſt I was ſuch a one as thy ſelf: thou thoughteſt I would admit thee into heaven, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the tranſgreſſions thou liveſt in.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Others ſurmiſe, that God is a hard maſter, one that puts heavy yokes upon the neck of his people that they cannot be able to bear. They think it a heavy yoke that they can take none of their curſed pleaſures and delights, and therefore they had as good be out of the world, ſhould they come to that near cloſing and joyning with God in Chriſt; to be one with him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A Fourth ſort ſurmiſe that God will accept of them, though they go on in the way of iniquity, if they repent at laſt.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:48673:103"/>5. A Fifth ſort are the formal civil ones, who think God will be ſatisfied if they pay every man his own, and do none any wrong, and perform the duties of Gods worſhip he requireth at their hands.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A Sixth ſort are thoſe that are detained from God by a diſtemper of unbelief. Unbelief cannot think that the love of God ſhould be extended to the worſt of ſinners: Nay ſaith the ſoul, the word of God hath declared the contrary; All ſhall not be the objects of the loving-kindneſs of God in Chriſt, therefore thoſe expreſions of his love belongs not to me, ſaith the Soul. Now there are two ways how this diſtemper comes thus to prevail, and there are two or three ſad effects it hath in the heart.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This diſtemper proceeds from another diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per even as bad, and that is from a ſenſual Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment maintained in the Soul. The glorious things of the Goſpel being inevident unto the eye of ſenſe, yea to the eye of reaſon, being things the eye of man, as man, never ſaw; nor the ear of man, as man, never heard; nor the heart of man, as man, never conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: a man muſt needs paſs a falſe Judgment upon them, when he Judgeth by a ſenſual Judgment, and ſay with <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> how can theſe things be? what to have ſuch iniquities and rebellions caſt by into the bottom of the Sea, and never remembred any more; To have my polluted Soul looked upon as righteous as an Angel it ſelf, by the imputed righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, how can it be? Now by judging the glorious Myſteries of the Goſpel thus, by a ſenſual judgment, the ſoul cometh to be jealous and ſupicious of God, that it cannot be, that God intends ſuch love towards his ſoul, as he manifeſts in his expreſſions.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:48673:103"/>2. This Jealouſie ariſeth from the ſouls meaſuring Gods way by its own way. According to this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, the ſoul thinks, if any man ſhould offer ſuch injury to me, as I have done to God, I might profeſs love, but I could never forget him; Therefore he concludes, the Lord can never forget thoſe injuries his ſoul hath offered to him. But God tells us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7 <hi>His ways are above our ways, and his thoughts above our thoughts:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, becauſe it is impoſſible for man to pardon ſo abundantly, that therefore I will not. Now in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods ways according to our ways, this jealouſie prevails, and doth produce theſe ſad effects in the heart, that prevent the ſouls diſcerning its union with Chriſt in the promiſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By this Diſtemper there are groundleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions drawn up by the ſoul againſt it ſelf. The ſoul once entertaining jealous thoughts of God, ſeldom ſtays there, but jealouſie like a Canker eats off more and more the good thoughts it ſhould have of God, till at laſt it draws full concluſions, that the Lord hath no good thoughts at all towards it. The ſoul commonly proceeds from care to fear, from fear to jealouſie, and from jealous ſuſpitions to hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This diſtemper cauſeth an evil eye in the ſoul. I mean this, he draws an evil concluſion from all Gods works: Let God vouchſafe precious revelations of the myſtery of his will, through the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt to him, while the heart remains under this diſtemper, What ſays the heart? I am afraid it is, but to harden me, I am afraid it is to increaſe my condemnation. Let God take away his ordinances again, and there is as ill a conſtruction made of that;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48673:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the ſoul under the jealouſie preſently concludeth, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> if the Lord intended any good to his ſoul, he would let him uſe the means, but ſaith the ſoul, I have abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the means, and now am deprived of it, and therefore now I fear there is no hope. Again, if you look upon the Lords dealing with the ſoul outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the Lord lay affliction upon him, now I may ſee indeed, ſaith he, that the Lord is angry, the Lords indignation is kindled againſt me for my ſin, and I know not but it may be a beginning of my ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting torments, and the ſoul never ſearcheth whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may out of faithfulneſs, that the Lord comes thus to chaſtiſe outwardly, according to that in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.95. Or let the Lord vouchſafe proſperity out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to ſuch a ſoul, ten to one as ſad conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are made of ſuch dealings of God too.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It cauſeth the ſoul to rely upon ſight and ſenſe alone, in its ſearching and ſeeking for the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his union with Jeſus Chriſt. The jealous heart will truſt God no further than he ſees him: So that hereby the ſoul remaineth under an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of attaining any aſſurance to his faith of his union with Chriſt, in regard by this the ſoul doth even renounce the uſe of faith. Now the ſpirit ſeeks to remove this diſtemper, and to bring the heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſweet confidence of God, and to crediting what God propounds, by theſe means.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſpirits repreſents the expreſſions of the Lords love to the ſoul, in the latitude and fulneſs of them. It makes it appear to be ſo full, ſo compleat and perfect a love, as there is not the leaſt imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cauſe of jealouſie: And ſurely this is the very intention of the Spirit of God, in ſo often heaping up expreſſions upon expreſſions, in ſetting out the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48673:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>
love of God in Chriſt: the Spirit of God doth even riſe to the higheſt kind of expreſſions that is poſſible in this way for this end, ſeldom names the grace of God, (that is to ſay the love of God) but he calls it riches of grace, nay abundant riches, and the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing riches of his grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit in this caſe reveals the Lords ſtrong confirmation of all thoſe expreſſions of his love. The Spirit reveals how the Lord hath bound himſelf to the performance of all thoſe expreſſions of love, in the latitude and fulneſs of them, to every <hi>Iota</hi> and point, to the leaſt tittle.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Spirit reveals the Lords promiſe of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, in the expreſſion of his love. Then in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19. God tells the Church, <hi>I will betroth thee unto my ſelf, in righteouſneſs and judgment, and in loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and in mercies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit reveals the Lords confirmation of it by his own hand writing. All the Scriptures are given as the hand writing of himſelf, only for the manifeſtation of the ſincerity, and integrity of the heart of God in the love he intends to Souls: The very end of writing all the Scriptures is primarily to draw Souls to believe, and ſecondarily, to believe gradually more and more to perfection, till they come to this full aſſurance of Faith. The whole Scriptures of the Lord and New Teſtament, are but one bleſſed letter of love, ſent from heaven by God, written by the bleſſed Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of heaven, the bleſſed Spirit of God; The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription is nothing elſe but this, My love to poor loveleſs rebellious ſouls through my dearly beloved Son the Lord Jeſus: The whole matter is nothing elſe but this, Come in and embrace my love.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:48673:105"/>3. The Spirit reaveals that the Lord hath added his oath to it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17. And this he doth that the ſoul may receive the ſtrongeſt conſolation from the Lords intentions in the reality of his love.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Spirit reveals the Lord hath confirmed it by Witneſſes, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7, 8, 9. The glorious Trinity, the three perſons in one Eſſence, they are Witneſſes to it. Jeſus Chriſt and the Holy Ghoſt are Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in Heaven, and the Water and Blood are Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on Earth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Spirit reveals, that the Lord hath confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it by Seals. The common broad Seals, I mean the Sacraments, that are outward Witneſſing ſigns, or Confirming ſigns of the Lords intentions of love to Souls in the Lord Jeſus. What is the Lords Supper but a meer confirming ſign, to confirm the Soul in believing the Faithfulneſs of God, and his loving Souls in Jeſus Chriſt; To witneſs to the Soul thus much, that as ſurely as he ſeeth the Bread broken, as he ſeeth the Wine poured out, ſo ſurely did the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God of Heaven and Earth, ſend the Dearly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of his own Soul cloathed with an humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to have his Body broken, and his Blood pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, that thereby there might be an union with himſelf, for ſuch a rebellious Soul. Nay the Lord hath given his privy Signet, which is the Seal of his own Spirit, that his Spirit ſhould aſſuredly Witneſs and Seal up unto Souls, his love in receiving them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Union with the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Spirit reveals the nature of God himſelf to the ſoul. It is not the knowledge of what God hath ſaid, but the knowledge of what God is in himſelf, that cauſeth the ſoul to truſt in him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. <hi>They that know thy name will truſt in thee;</hi> That is, they
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48673:105"/>
that know the Lord indeed: while the nature of God is unknown, unbelief of neceſſity bares rule in every Soul.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Spirit of God reveals the Lords removal of all cauſes of ſuſpition or Jealouſie whatever, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lords faithfulneſs and love. There are but two general grounds of Jealouſie.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Some experience of the unfaithfulneſs of God. Now the Spirit hath prevented the leaſt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary ground this way; in regard the Lord hath never failed in performing to the uttermoſt, all the love he expreſſed hitherto,</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſecond ground of Jealouſie muſt be ſome fear of the Lords taking diſlike of the Soul, becauſe of the Souls unfaithfulneſs to God. Now the Spirit of God reveals to the Soul, the Lords removal of all grounds of ſuſpition, by ſhewing the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not to take any miſlike from loving of ſouls, whatever imaginary wickedneſs the Soul ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit againſt him. That is, the Spirit reveals the Lords declaration of paſſing by the treachery and filthineſs of the Soul, or remembring its iniquity no more; That is, the Spirit reveals the Lords conſtant accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Souls after treachery, without reſpect to the treachery, to diminiſh his love for it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And laſtly, The Spirit of God reveals the Lords preſſing urgent perſwaſions, invitations, and commands, to a fulneſs of confidence of all the love to poor Souls that he hath expreſſed to them. Thereupon the Spirit comes to argue thus, Wilt thou not truſt the Lord, that knows his own love and compaſſions beſt of all? He alone knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and thou art not able to comprehend him; The light that thou haſt is but a ſmall ſpark, ſaith the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48673:106"/>
Spirit of God, to that great light that dwels in him, and wilt thou truſt to thine own ſpark of light, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to the fountain of light? Hereby in all theſe ways the Spirit of God removes this Jealous Diſtemper, plucks out this Beam from the Souls Eyes, and brings the Soul into a precious believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frame. This is the Firſt part of the Fourth Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper that the Spirit of God muſt remove, and that is the Jealouſie of God.</p>
               <p>There is a ſecond Branch of this Jealouſie, or a ſecond way, how this Diſtemper of Jealouſie works; and that is as it works towards the Souls own heart. The Devil endeavours to make the Soul Jealous of his own heart, and would have him ſuſpect that his own wicked heart cannot receive the will of God rightly, and to make it fear it ſhould cloſe falſly, if it ſhould think of receiving the bleſſed will of God. This Diſtemper of Jealouſie is hardly heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe it hath ſo ſtrong a hold, it comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhape of Godlineſs, It hath a pretence of the greateſt ſincerity and integrity that is poſſible, it tells the Soul it is a ſign of ſincerity to be jealous of its own deceitfulneſs, it tells the Soul it were a ſign of preſumption if it were not jealous.</p>
               <p>This Diſtemper we ſhall endeavour to diſcover, and for the clearing of it you muſt conceive, that I do not condemn all jealouſie in a Soul. There are divers kindes of Jealouſie that the Scripture ſpeaks of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a Jealouſie over others, leaſt they ſhould miſcarry. Which is a holy ſupition min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with a holy fear of their departing from God, and alſo joyned with a ſtrength of deſire of their keeping cloſe unto God. This kind of jealouſie
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48673:106"/>
was in the heart of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>I am Jealous over you with a Godly Jealouſie, that I may preſent you as a chaſt Virgin unto Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There may be a jealouſie in the heart that is occaſioned upon the ſight of good in others, and the excellency they have attained to. That's a kind of emulation; That you ſhall read of <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.11. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Jows,</hi> that God had not caſt them off alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether out of a purpurpoſe that they might fall, but that through their fall the Gentiles might be called, that the <hi>Jews</hi> might be provoked to Jealouſie; that is, that they might be provoked to a kind of emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to envy to go beyond the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> Thus a Chriſtians heart may be Jealous, leaſt another go before him, and attain to a greater degree of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs then his Soul attainneth to: This is a Godly Jealouſie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a Jealouſie over the deceitfulneſs of the heart, leaſt the curſed heart ſhould delude it, and prove treacherous, and joyn hand in hand with the Devil in ſome curſed Plot againſt the Soul. This is a Godly Jealouſie if it be kept within bounds: This Jealouſie over the heart, if it be right, is a compounded affection, made up of two ſimple af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, of the zeal of love, and the zeal of hatred: Or rather, it is a kind of third thing that ariſeth from both theſe, that is a zeal of love to God, and the ways of God, and a zeal of hatred againſt whatever is contrary to the will of the bleſſed God, ſo that there ariſes a kind of ſuſpition of every thing that may poſſibly ſtep in to diſhonour God. This Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iouſie hath but two objects to which it can work.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All things that may ſtep in to be corrival with God. That is, whatever might ſtrive to inſinuate
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48673:107"/>
into the heart, to ſteal away the heart from God, or to be co-ſharer with God, to be a fellow beloved one with God himſelf: Thus the world and all the world afords, comes in to be the object concerning which the Soul exerciſeth this Jealouſie, the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life, theſe ſtrive with all their ſtrength to be corrivals with God in the heart, to have as equal a ſhare in the heart as God, and to be as highly loved and honoured as God. Now over theſe things the heart may be exceeding Jealous, and ought to maintain a conſtant Jealouſie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond object of Jealouſie is the Souls own act towards God. That is, whatever working there may be towards God, there may be a diſpoſition in the heart to deal fainedly and hypocritically. Now in that regard becauſe the heart is treacherous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it ſelf, a heart falſe to God, filled with enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt God, therefore all the actions and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the heart, are the objects upon which this Jealouſie may be exerciſed in a right holy godly way. There may be five acts of Jealouſie in every Soul lawfull, nay that ought to be.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Soul may be ſo Jealous of it ſelf, as to call his heart to a ſtrict account, concerning all the motions of it, throughout all the whole courſe of his converſation. He may be ſo ſuſpitious, as never to give credit to his heart in any thing, any further than it can give a good account to him, in all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It may call its heart to account, in what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree it hath wrought towards any of thoſe objects. To call the heart to account, whether the affections did not run out too much after the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It may call its heart to account, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48673:107"/>
the occaſions it hath had to deal with any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject whatever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Soul may diſcover the danger, and ſpread forth all the evil before the treacherous heart. The Spirit of Jealouſie may work ſo far, that it may ſtrive to put a bit and bridle into the wanton heart to reſtrain it; It may ſtrive to propound principles that may prevent its treachery.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A ſoul may cry mightily to God with all his ſtrength, to prevent the wretched deceitfulneſs of his own heart: To diſcover all the hidden by-paths that his own heart hath to walk in, to give him light from heaven to ſee every ſtep that his heart ſets.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Soul may ſummons his own deceitful heart to appear before the Lord, to act as in the ſight of the heart-ſearching God, in its cloſing with the Lord Chriſt tendered.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It may ſo work as to cauſe the ſoul to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all confidence in it ſelf, of an uprightneſs in his own heart, in its cloſing with the Lord Chriſt tendered. So that thus far you ſee, there is a Holy Jealouſie of Spirit, over the curſed deceitful heart, that may poſſeſs, yea ought to poſſeſs any Godly Soul. But there is a diſtempered Jealouſie too, that darkens the Soul, and prevents the Souls receiving aſſurance to his faith from the promiſe of his union with Chriſt; and that is when this Spirit of Jealouſie works in theſe four or five ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When the Spirit of Jealouſie prevails ſo far, as to obtain the ſole command of the heart. Now this Jealouſie cometh to be the rage of a man, ſo as it becomes a diſtempered paſſion, in ſtead of a holy affection; So as inſtead of putting the ſoul into a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious way of ſearching out the deceit of his own
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48673:108"/>
heart, it rather draws concluſions againſt it ſelf, without weighing and examining, what the deceits of the heart are that are ſuſpected.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When this Jealouſie makes the Soul negligent or careleſs of the uſe of the means, to find out the truth of what it ſuſpects. So that in ſtead of this, the heart ſits down under thoſe fears and ſuſpicions, crying out, my wretched heart will deceive me, I dare not think of receiving the Lord Jeſus ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When the Soul is ſo overcome with Jealouſie, that it takes no account of it ſelf, of the ground of the working of the Jealouſie. It is the ordinary diſtemper of Souls that are overcome with this Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, that they never look out to the precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, wherein the Lord engages himſelf to prevent the deceitfulneſs of the heart, and its departing from God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When this Jealouſie ſo prevails, as it is taken up by the Soul as a ſufficient Plea againſt the Souls preſent believing and receiving the Lord Jeſus ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. When the Soul ſets this Jealouſie over his own deceitfull heart like a bulwark, againſt all that can be propounded to him, to make him give credit to the will of God, and to yield obedience to the Lord Chriſt tendered: when the heart thinks it is enough that he is able to ſay, truly the very deſire of my Soul is to yield obedience to the command of God in believing, ſain would I receive the Lord Jeſus tendered, but alas I have ſuch a curſed deceitfull heart that I dare not, leaſt my heart delude me.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When the Jealouſie over the heart prevails ſo much, as the Soul ſpends all his thoughts in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the uprightneſs of his heart in cloſing, before
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48673:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the ſoul venture upon an actual cloſing with the Lord Jeſus as tendered. When a Soul through this Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie ſets porcing and gazing upon the many wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and turnings of his own ſpirit, and calling to remembrance how wretchedly his heart deluded him formerly, and hereupon concludes with himſelf, that he may not cloſe till he can ſee the uprightneſs of his heart, in cloſing with the Lord Jeſus; And ſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon afterwards ſpends all his prayers, and pours out all his deſires to God for uprightneſs, for integrity of heart in cloſing, and in the mean time forbearing that actual cloſing that the Lord requires without the leaſt delay from every Soul. Thus you ſee alſo how this Jealouſie comes to work in a ſinfull way, and becomes a ſinfull Diſtemper; And indeed when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> cometh thus work, it exceedingly darkens the Soul, and prevents its diſcerning what the promiſe holds forth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard Jealouſie prevents the ſouls gazing upon the abſolute promiſe that is tendered to the ſoul. Now the ſoul muſt needs be kept from diſcerning what the promiſe holds forth, when it is kept from ſo much as looking into the promiſe; for though there be habitual divine light in the promiſe, yet thats not uſefull till it be drawn out into exerciſe. Habitual divine light in the underſtanding, is like the eye when it is aſleep, or like the eye when it is ſhut, It is the exerciſe of that, that makes the ſoul diſcern any thing that the Lord diſcovers in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; And then it is the very gazing upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that draws out that divine light formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in exerciſe alſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Diſtemper of Jealouſie maintains perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual fear in the ſoul, of its falſe applying of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48673:109"/>
of the Lord Jeſus. Fear is always the compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jealouſie, the more fearful the ſoul is, the more jealous, and the more jealous the ſoul is, the more fearful; and thoſe fears are like a thick fog or miſt, that darkens the divine light received: So that by this means the ſoul is kept from diſcerning any of thoſe beams of divine light in any clearneſs, that the promiſe of God holds forth, and thereby the ſoul is kept from diſcerning his union with the Lord Jeſus, that might be diſcerned from the promiſes, Now this jealouſie over the heart it ſelf muſt be healed, before the ſoul can receive clear ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it ſelf of its union with Chriſt.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="202-305" type="pages">
               <p>Two ways the ſpirit of God uſually heals this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſpirit preſſeth with all urgency upon the ſoul, the preſent immediate neceſſity of his yielding obedience to the command of God, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatever of any delay and deferring. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly upon theſe diſtempers of Jealouſie prevailing, the ſoul denies not the Lord Jeſus tendered, only conceiveth himſelf to have ſufficient ground to delay and defer a while, till he ſee clearly a more ſutable uprightneſs in his heart to cloſe. Now the ſpirit comes upon the ſoul, and preſſes it upon his heart to be his duty immediately without the leaſt delay; Hereby the ſoul begins to be drawn to adventure to believe, though it be with trembling, leſt his wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heart ſhould deceive him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſpirit diſcovers to the ſoul, the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of his own intereſt in the promiſe, upon any act of his own conſidered in himſelf. The ſpirit clears to the ſoul the Lords engagement of himſelf, as well to make the heart faithful, and true and upright, in receiving the Lord Jeſus tendered, as to give the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48673:109"/>
Lord Jeſus to the ſoul that would receive him. The ſpirit it may be brings ſuch a promiſe as that <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and I will be their God and they ſhall be my people;</hi> and reveals to the ſoul from thence, the Lords engagement of himſelf to put in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into the deceitful hypocritical heart, whereby the cloſe ſhall be in truth and ſincerity, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the wretched wickedneſs of his own heart ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to deceive him.</p>
               <p>The Fifth Dark Diſtemper is, The ſouls meaſuring and judging its ſelf, too too much by other Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Dark Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</note> by the graces and excellencies that ſhine forth in other ſouls.</p>
               <p>We ſhall open it to you, how far it is lawful for a ſoul thus to meaſure himſelf by other Chriſtians, and by the rule of their graces: And then how this diſtemper comes to prevail, and how it works. It muſt be concluded, that there is a lawfulneſs in a ſouls meaſuring himſelf by the rule and line of the graces of other Chriſtians, to try his own heart and way, by comparing his own heart &amp; way by the heart &amp; way of other Chriſtians as far as he can diſcern. There are ſeven or eight particular acts that are not only lawful for a ſoul in this caſe, but the ſoul is bound to them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Every ſoul allured towards the Lord Jeſus, ought with the greateſt diligence and circumſpection that is poſſible, to have a full proſpect, a full view, into the hearts and lives of other Chriſtians. The Lord hath intended from eternity, to propoſe the whole number of Saints, like ſo many glorious heavenly Stars, ſet in the lower region of the earth, from whence the beams of his own excellency may
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48673:110"/>
ſhine forth: They are ſet like ſo many Suns in the Firmament, for all the World to gaze upon; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.18. <hi>The righteous is like the Sun, that ſhineth more and more untill the perfect day:</hi> Yea fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, The precious beams of the Lords own glory, are appointed to ſhine forth through their light; So that every ſoul neglects the beholding of the glory of God himſelf, in the precious glaſſes that he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for his people, to ſee the reflection of his glory in, when they neglect to make a diligent ſearch into the hearts of all Chriſtians within view.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Every ſoul ought, in the view that he takes of the hearts and lives of Saints and their graces, to have a reflection upon his heart and life, and his own grace. Every ſoul ought to look upon theſe Saints, as we look upon glaſſes, that we may diſcern our own faces.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Every Chriſtian ought to compare his own gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with the graces he diſcerns in all Chriſtians with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his view. Firſt, they ought to meaſure the graces themſelves. Secondly, the expreſſions of thoſe graces in their duties. Firſt, they ought to meaſure the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces themſelves, even the inward habits of grace, ſo far as they can diſcern them in others. 1. They ought to compare the ſtrength of their own graces, with the ſtrength and vigor of thoſe graces they diſcern in other Chriſtians. 2. They ought to compare the ſtrength of their own graces with the graces of others, in the fruit and increaſe of it. When any Chriſtian flouriſheth, like a Tree planted by the waters ſide, that brings forth his fruit in due ſeaſon, every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ought to compare the growth of his own grace, to the growth of the grace of ſuch a Chriſtian. 3. They ought to compare the time of growth of the grace of ſuch a Chriſtian, with the time that their grace hath
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48673:110"/>
had to grow. 4. To compare the means of growth of grace. A ſoul diſcerning any grace exerciſed in any Chriſtian, ought to conſider what means he hath had to grow to that eminency in ſuch a grace; whether have I had the ſame means? whether hath the means been as effectual upon my heart, as upon ſuch a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian? 5. To compare the livelineſs and activity of all thoſe graces conſtantly, with the livelineſs and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of their own. Secondly, they ought to compare the expreſſions of their own graces in way of duty to God, with the expreſſions of the graces of others.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in the quantity of the duties.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the quality of the duties.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in the quantity of the duties, in the number and bulk of them, God ſometimes ſtands much upon quantity of duty to his people: Therefore upon a Souls diſcerning ſome Chriſtians to be much in duty, it may be to ſpend much time in prayer, they ought to compare themſelves and their own duties, with the duties of others. Only theſe two rules are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in it. Firſt, to obſerve whether the duties of any ſuch Chriſtians be not extended too far, that they do not place the opinion of all good in duty, that they do not bound and ſtint God to ſuch a length in duty. Now duties may be extended too far, there may be exceſs in performing duties of prayer. 1. When ordinary duties are performed in exceſs by a ſoul without an extraordinary occaſion. 2. When duties are extended beyond the ſouls ability and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Ability and opportunity are conſtant limitations ſet to all the duties God requires. Secondly, this rule alſo muſt be obſerved. That a ſoul does keep a right proportion, in all his meaſuring of his own duties by others duties. 1. Every ſoul upon diſcerning any
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:48673:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Chriſtian to excell in the quantity of duty, ought to compare his own ability with others ability. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Lord giveth ſo he requireth, to whom much is given from him he expects much. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.48. Though the duty of one Chriſtian ſhould not be ſo much in quantity, as the duty of another, yet it may be as much, conſidering the ſouls ability every way, for the duty that he performeth. 2. The ſoul muſt always look to proportion the occaſion. It muſt ſee upon what occaſion ſuch a Chriſtian is ſo much exerciſed in duties, and ſee whether the ſame occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be his ſouls. In time of temptation, or in time of violent corruption, or in time of much inward bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of ſoul, it ought to exerciſe the quantity of duties, more than at another time. If occaſions come in extraordinary, the Lord requires extraordinary duties. As in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7, 8, when <hi>Paul</hi> was urged with an extraordinary temptation, a thorn prickt him in the fleſh, then <hi>Paul</hi> falls upon extraordinary duty, he prayed thrice, that is often. So in <hi>Act.</hi> 12, when <hi>Peter</hi> was in priſon, and likely to be brought to execution, the Church went to prayer without ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 2. The ſoul muſt always proportion his own op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, to the opportunity of thoſe he diſcerns to be much in duty. Opportunity is a talent as well as any thing elſe, and the Lord expects the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that talent as well as other talents: where the Lord gives opportunity for duty, he requireth much duty. 4. The ſoul alſo is to proportion its ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. Now the neceſſities of ſouls are various: One needs a great deal of food to maintain the life of his ſoul, and another may be maintained with leſs. 5. There muſt be a proportion held in the ſpiritual engagements and obligations, wherein a ſoul ſtands
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:48673:111"/>
engaged to God. 1. The proportion muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerved, in the ſouls reception of the ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God. The more fully the ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is come down into the heart, the more neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the heart engaged to duty, and to greater mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of duty, in regard by the receit of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit of adoption, there is greater ability con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into the ſoul for the duty. 2. The ſoul muſt hold proportion in his revelations of the truth of God to the ſoul. The more clear beams of divine light of truth, the Lord communicates to any ſoul, the more deeply is that ſoul engaged to God &amp; unto duty. 3. The ſoul muſt proportion the engagement of the Lords making his perſon more conſpicuous to the world. The more conſpicuouſly the Lord ſets up any ſoul, to be gazed upon by the world, the more doth the Lord engage the ſoul to all kind of duty. 4. They muſt proportion the degree of communion, that God vouchſafeth to take the ſoul into with himſelf. Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually according to the degree of communion the ſoul hath with God, ſo are the ſouls engagements to the multiplication of duty. That's the firſt branch of this way of meaſuring, The ſoul muſt meaſure the quantity of his duties.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſoul muſt alſo meaſure and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the quality of his own duties, with the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the duties he perceiveth to be performed by others. It is not the bulk only God accepts, but it is the manner, the ſpirituality, the exactneſs and exquiſitneſs of the performing thoſe duties, that the Lord eſpecially looks at. The Iſraelites ſeldom failed in the bulk of the duty the Lord required, they gave him his Oxen, and Lambs, and He Goats and Sheep, and the like; but they failed in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48673:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of thoſe duties of worſhip that the Lord required, and therefore the Lord called thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blations, vain oblations. So that though the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of a ſouls duty ſhould hold proportion with the quantity of the duty of others, yet he muſt look whether the quality will hold proportion, whether the ſpirituality of the duty will proportion with their duty, whether there be as much inward adoration before God, as much inward ſelf abaſement of ſpirit, as much ſtrength in purſuing after Communion with God. Neither is it ſufficient for the quality of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to hold proportion with the quality of the duties of ſome other Chriſtians, but all the former rules al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo muſt be obſerved as far as they can be applied to this. Where the Lord hath furniſhed with more inward ability, and inward ſtrength, there he looks for the duty to excell in quality as well as quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. Thus you have the third act of the ſoul open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is the comparing of his own graces, with the graces it diſcerns in the hearts and lives of other Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The ſoul may from comparing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with other Chriſtians, and his graces and his duties with theirs, endeavour to convict himſelf of all the evil that can be found out, either in his heart or life.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To convince him of all his voluntary defects. By diſcerning how the principles of other Chriſtians are improved to the honour of God, the ſoul may convince himſelf of his wilfull defects, that he that hath received the ſame principle, ſhould walk ſo far contrary to God.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:48673:112"/>2. The Soul may indeavour to convince it ſelf, of all his unſuitable walking to his Profeſſion, by gazing upon the brightneſs of that principle of Chriſtianity profeſſed by other Chriſtians, that ſhine forth in their Converſations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Soul may indeavour to convince it ſelf of his own unſutableneſs in his walking, to his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements unto God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, of his unſuitableneſs to the reſt of the Members of the Body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Every Soul ought to endeavour to break his own Heart, for any diſproportion he can diſcern between his own Life and the Lives of other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; between his own Grace, and their Graces. There are many pretious Soul-melting arguments, that a Soul may help it ſelf to towards the breaking of his own heart, for any unſutable walking towards Jeſus Chriſt, by meaſuring his own Life and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with the Graces of other Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Soul may be helped to a clearer ſight of the tranſcendency of the riches of the Lords Grace in Chriſt to his Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Soul may have a diſcovery of the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative degree of the perverſeneſs of his Heart to God. Seeing the diſproportion between him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and other Chriſtians; he may ſay, Lord, what a curſed, crooked, helliſh, perverſe Heart have I!</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Soul may have a diſcovery of the height of diſhonour done to Jeſus Chriſt by him, when he ſhall ſee that thoſe that he profeſſes himſelf to be fellow members with, ſo bearing up the brightneſs of the Image of Jeſus Chriſt in their Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and then reflect upon himſelf, and ſee ſcarce
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48673:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo much as any ſpark of that glorious Image of Chriſt to ſhine forth in him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From thence the Soul may have an inward holy ſhame to ſeize upon it, to ſee the growth and increaſe of the Members of Chriſt, his Brethren, and ſee himſelf ſo barren, ſo empty and poor.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Every Soul may and ought to paſs the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of condemnation againſt his own Soul, from a diſcovery of any unſutableneſs in his Heart and Life, to the Hearts and Lives of other Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. A Soul may meaſure himſelf ſo far by the Graces of others, as to draw quickning arguments from thence, to awaken his Heart to more watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, diligence and circumſpection.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the ſight of the Graces of other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans excelling his own, a Soul may and ought to propound to himſelf the Lords ſeparation of his Soul as only peculiar to himſelf, as well as the Souls, of thoſe that ſo much excel him in Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Soul may from thence propound to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the Lords predeſtination of him, to as full a a participation of the fulneſs of Chriſt, as any of thoſe that he ſees excel him in Grace. From thence the Soul may argue with God, why ſhould others have ſuch a large ſpark of Grace from Chriſt, when I am ſo empty and poor, and have ſcarce any thing of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Soul may from hence find out this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the glory and honour of Jeſus Chriſt as much depends upon his Soul, as upon the Souls of other Chriſtians that ſo far excel him in Grace.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Soul may from thence propound to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a neceſſity of conformity between all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48673:113"/>
of Jeſus Chriſt, and thereby awaken his Heart to ſtrive for the height of perfection, or Grace, that he diſcerns in any Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. And laſtly, the Soul may and ought to keep a conſtant view of the Graces of all other Chriſtians within his ſight, with a conſtant refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon his own Heart, ſo as to provoke him to Jealouſie, to a kind of Emulation, leaſt other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould magnifie and exalt the name of Jeſus Chriſt, by a ſutable converſation, more than he. Thus you ſee how far it is lawful for any Chriſtian to meaſure himſelf by other Chriſtians, by their Hearts and Lives, their Graces and Duties.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be opened is, when a Soul meaſuring himſelf by other Chriſtians becomes a dark ſinful diſtemper; or when a Soul meaſures himſelf too too much by other Chriſtians; ſo that by meaſuring himſelf by others, he keeps himſelf from that bleſſed heavenly light that ſhould ſhine into his Heart, whereby he might receive ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his union with Chriſt. There are four ways, how this meaſuring a mans ſelf by other Chriſtians, becomes a dark diſtemper.</p>
               <p n="1">I. When a man makes his conformity to the Graces and Duties of other Chriſtians, to be the ground of his Faith; either in the firſt act of Faith, in conſenting to the bleſſed will of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, or elſe in the renewed exerciſe of Faith again upon any occaſion. That is thus, when the Soul conceives himſelf to have good grounds to hope that the Lord is willing to accept his Soul into union with Chriſt, when he ſees the ſame ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and activity of Spirit for God, the ſame Heavenlineſs and Spirituality, the ſame pretious
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48673:114"/>
Diſpoſitions working in their ſtrength in his Soul to God, that he diſcerns to be in other Chriſtians: And on the contrary the Soul conceives himſelf to have no good ground to believe the Lords willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to accept his loveleſs Soul in Chriſt; when he diſcerns a great diſproportion between his Heart and other Chriſtians, when he beholds his own Heart dead, and other Chriſtians lively; his own Heart ſhut up, and others inlarged in all their faculties towards God. This diſtemper is both exceeding ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and exceeding dark, when it grows once to this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a proportioning the love of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards poor loveleſs Souls, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Grace and Holineſs in that Soul. Yea the Soul by this makes the Eternal unchangeable love of God to be alterable, various, and change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, according to the alterations and variations of Mans Heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a vailing and eclipſing at leaſt, if not a nullifying, the freedom of the Lords love in Chriſt, to poor loveleſs deſpicable Souls. It is a making the Lords love to depend upon the Graces and Holineſs in Souls, and to be conveyed into Souls upon that ground.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It makes the Soul nullifie, undervalue, and wretchedly diſparage all the pretious promiſes in Gods bleſſed Book. The Soul makes thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Words of God inſufficient to ſupport and uphold a poor ſinking, troubled, laden Soul, and to ſatisfie it concerning Gods will, to receive it into union with himſelf in the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is a departing from the pretious Springs of Conſolation, digged by the Omnipotent God for thirſty Souls, and a chooſing a poor empty dry brook.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:48673:114"/>II. When a Soul in making a juſt parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween himſelf and others, makes every defect that he beholds in the proportion of his own Graces and Duties, to the Graces and Duties of other Chriſtians, to be a ſufficient ground whence to draw a concluſion of his contrary ſtate, to the ſtate of other Chriſtians, that he beholds to excel him in ſo a high a meaſure. When it riſeth to this, it becomes a ſinful dark diſtemper, and that will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in divers things,</p>
               <p n="1">1. This may prove a meaſuring of Gods love, by the acts of his love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be an arguing meerly from a Souls want of light to diſcern Gods good will to him in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It makes the Soul draw a concluſion of the total want of the being of Grace; while a Soul thus concludes, becauſe he ſeeth no Graces ſhining forth in himſelf, as he doth in others, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is not beloved of God in Chriſt; it may come to argue in this manner, becauſe I ſee my Soul is not ſuch a burning and ſhining light, as ſuch a Chriſtian, therefore I am not ſo much as ſmoaking flax.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This argument from the defect of Grace, may be an argument from the Souls infirmity. It may be but an argument from the Tyranny that ſome luſt hath exerciſed over the Heart, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding it is under the voluntary ſervice of his luſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It may be a reaſoning from the want of fruitfulneſs in Chriſtianity, to the want of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity it ſelf, and the want of all fritfulneſs what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. Now when the Soul is about to draw ſuch
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48673:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
concluſions as theſe, from its meaſuring it ſelf by other Chriſtians, let theſe things be obſerved;</p>
               <p n="1">1. He muſt firſt aſſure himſelf, that the defect he beholds in his own Soul is a ſinful defect. Four things the Soul muſt be aſſured the defect comes not from, before he can be aſſured the defect is Sin.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That it is not barely through the ſuſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the influence of the comforting Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It muſt be aſſured that the defects he beholds in his own Soul, of the Graces of others, be not through the Lords ſuſpending the arbitrary influences of the quickning Spirit of Chriſt. You muſt conceive there are influences that are for the Souls Being, and influences that are for the Souls well Being. Theſe influences of the quickning Spirit of Chriſt that are for the Souls Being, are never withdrawn, But the influences that are for the Souls well Being, are communicated in various degrees, to various Souls, which therefore I call arbitrary influances of the Spirit of Chriſt, that is, ſuch as God diſpoſes of according to his meer pleaſure to the Soul, in divers degrees, at divers times, and to divers Souls in divers times.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Soul muſt be aſſured, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect he beholds in his own Soul, in reſpect of the Graces of other Chriſtians, proceeds not only from the defects of gifts, thar others furniſhed with the ſame Graces injoy above him. Gifts are like a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious cundit-pipes, that the Lord hath appointed to let out the ſtreams of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt through: Now if another Soul hath more abundance of thoſe kind of gifts, more readineſs
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48673:115"/>
of Capacity, quickneſs of Underſtanding, greater depths in the apprehenſion of the things of Chriſt; clearneſs of light, more readineſs of expreſſion; Then thy Soul may be deceived, in judging a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter degree of Grace in ſuch a Soul than in thy Soul; in regard he hath a greater opportunity of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Grace, and a greater aptneſs to hold forth Grace received, than thou haſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Soul muſt be aſſured that it is not from the defect of the means and opportunity on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without any negligence of any means by the Soul, that his defect of Grace proceeds from.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Soul muſt be aſſured, that thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects that he beholds in himſelf, are ſuch defects as are altogether inconſiſtent with the ſtate of the union of the Soul with Chriſt. Whatever gives a true and ſufficient demonſtration of its cauſe, muſt be an effect that proceeds properly from ſuch a cauſe only, that cannot proceed from another cauſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Soul muſt be alſo ſure that Spiritual Raſhneſs, and Wilfulneſs, or Ignorance, or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, do not overcloud his Judgment, in his ſearching out and trying the defects in the Soul. Therein I ſhall adviſe to three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Soul ought to be ſure that he truſt not his own light alone.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Soul ought to bring all things, both in their ſubſtance, and in their circumſtances, that are worthy to be weighed, to the rule of the Word alone.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Soul muſt endeavour that his Judgment be ſettled by God. Thats thus; The Soul that hath his Judgment paſt upon his own defects, and the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48673:116"/>
nature of them to be ſuch, as is inconſiſtent with the ſtate of union with Chriſt, muſt endeavour to draw near to God; to bring himſelf into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Heart ſearching God, with a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous apprehenſion, and meditation, that all the ſecrets of his Spirit are open before God; and then, and there in this frame to view over again, and meditate upon, that Judgment that he finds himſelf ready to paſs againſt his own Soul, and then obſerve whether his Spirit then dare paſs this concluſion againſt himſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">III. When a Soul in meaſuring himſelf by others, makes the defect of Grace in himſelf, to be the matter of diſcouragement of his Soul, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of impediment to the exerciſe of his Faith in Chriſt. That is, when the Soul by looking upon ſome other Chriſtians, and beholding many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, gratious, holy diſpoſitions ſhine forth, like ſo many Stars in the lower orb, when he ſees much holy fire drop down from Heaven into their Hearts, that drop forth in their Converſations; and looks upon himſelf and ſees a defect in all: Sees his own Heart overgrown with dulneſs, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidneſs, blockiſhneſs, careleſneſs, forgetfulneſs of God, regardleſneſs of Communion with God in Chriſt, and the Soul makes theſe defects of Grace apprehended in himſelf, matter of diſcouragement to his Soul, to beat it off, and to keep it back from the exerciſe of Faith. Then this diſtemper of Judging themſelves by others prevails too far.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a joyning with the wretched, corrupt, oppoſit Heart againſt Chriſt, and the furniſhing the Soul with matter of cavil and ſcruple, againſt the bleſſed tenders of receiving the love of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:48673:116"/>2. By this the Soul maketh that part of his duty that he ſeems to perform, to be nothing but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. The Soul by looking upon the Graces that ſhine forth in any Chriſtian, ſeems to do a part of his duty, becauſe it is one thing commanded; and in reflecting upon his own Heart in the ſight of thoſe Graces, ſeems to do another part of his duty; but both theſe are made diſobedience, when the Soul makes the defect of Grace, he finds in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when he looks upon the Graces of others, diſcouragements to himſelf in exerciſing Faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Soul croſſes God in his higheſt end, which is to make the excellencies of Jeſus Chriſt ſhine forth in the Souls of his People.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The fourth caſe wherein a Soul doth mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure himſelf too much by others, ſo as it becomes a ſinful diſtemper, is, when the diſproportion a Soul finds out between himſelf and other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; his Graces and their Graces, his Duties and their Duties, are made a ſufficient ground for the Soul, to draw a final concluſion of his own eſtate from. As thus, when a Soul argueth in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I ſee there are none of thoſe pretious work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Spirit of God in my Spirit, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and ſee apparent, are in the Spirits of ſuch and ſuch Chriſtians; they have their Hearts ſo powerfully drawn by Jeſus Chriſt to cloſe with him in a way of union, that they are inabled by a mighty power from God to believe; but, ſaith the Soul, I do not find that God draws my Heart, and comes with a mighty power to conſtrain my Soul to cloſe with the Lord Jeſus tendred, and therefore ſurely God never intended good to my Soul. That this is a dark and ſinful diſtemper, will
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48673:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
appear in divers things, for there may be many diſproportions between one Chriſtian and another, that are not ſinful diſproportions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There may be a diſproportion without a mans ſin, in the manner, and order, and degree, yea in the very Being of all the workings of God in the Soul, before the actual union of the Soul with Chriſt, by any act of believing.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There may be a diſproportion in the fear of Conſcience, that other Chriſtians have had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, before their actual conſent to the Lord Chriſt tendred, and the fear of Conſcience that thou haſt hitherto had.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A diſproportion may be in the grief of mind for ſin, that other Chriſtians have had upon them for ſin, before their union with Chriſt, and the grief of mind thy Soul hath hitherto had upon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There may be a diſproportion in the effects that fear of Conſcience and grief of mind do naturally produce in Souls: As doubtfulneſs, and multitude of ſcruples and objections againſt thine own Soul. Theſe indeed are the common effects that grief of mind and the fear of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence produce: And there may be a great diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between thy doubtings, and the doubtings of other Chriſtians, and yet no ſin neither, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this; becauſe neither fear of Conſcience, nor doubt of mind, nor ſcruples and objections againſt the Soul, do in the leaſt commend any Soul to God: As all things are ſin before union with Chriſt, ſo is the fear of Conſcience, and grief of mind, ſin, and all thoſe doubts and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, ſin, and therefore have not the leaſt
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48673:117"/>
vertue in them to commend a Soul to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There may be a diſproportion in the degrees of Grace without ſin.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There may have been a difference in the time of the growth of his Grace, and the Graces of others by which he meaſures himſelf. It may be he yet remains but a green tender plant in the Houſe of the Lord, and meaſures himſelf by an old flouriſhing green Olive in Gods houſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There may be a difference in the helps and means of growth. The field is not blamed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not ſo fruitful as the garden, when the garden is daily watred and dreſſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There may be a diſproportion in the actings of Grace and yet no ſin.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In regard there may not be the ſame ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to occaſion to act Grace in thee, that is in others. The occaſions are like the Wind to the Ship, that ſet the Ship a going: They are but the heavenly Winds as it were, that blow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Grace, that ſet Graces a working; and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Graces muſt and ought to work according to the variety of occaſions; Now according to the neceſſity of the Soul, ſo God binds himſelf in Covenant to provide for the Soul.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Graces of other Chriſtians, may be acted by an extraordinary influence of the quickning Spirit of Chriſt. I call it extraordinary, in regard it is that which is not common at all times, to all Chriſtians, that have ſome of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the quickning Spirit of Chriſt; ſo that by ſome extraordinary gale from Heaven his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be acted, and through thy want of thoſe quicknings of the Spirit of Chriſt, thy Graces
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48673:118"/>
may not be ſo acted, and yet not ſin.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There may be a difference in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward excitation, and quickning unto the actings of Grace. A Soul ſtands not only in neceſſity of the inward breathings of the Spirit of Chriſt, but of the outward excitation too, in regard it is through the outward excitation, that the Lord hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed thoſe inward breathings of his quickning Spirit: Now if other Chriſtians by whom thy Soul do meaſure it ſelf, ſhould injoy more excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that is, that they have more Bellows blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Grace in their Hearts than thine, though there may be difference in the acting, the bare diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion may not be thy ſin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There may be many ſinful diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, that yet deſtroy not the Being of the Souls union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There may be a diſproportion in Faith it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There may be a want of moſt of the higheſt and excellent operations of Faith, and yet not the Being of union deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Faith may be oppreſſed with doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſtruſt, and yet not be ſuppreſſed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There may be the want of almoſt all ſtedfaſtneſs, ſtability and conſtancy in the acting of Faith; ſo that a Soul can ſeldom keep his Heart in a believing frame one moment, and yet that ſinful defect may not nullifie the union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There may be a ſinful diſproportion in all the Spiritual life of the Soul, and yet the union with Chriſt hold. That is, all the principles of Spiritual motion towards God, may be unactive,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48673:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when thou ſeeſt others full of life and activity, and yet this ſinfull diſproportion doth not deſtroy the union. Now it appears to be a ſad diſtemper thus to meaſure the Soul by others.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard there is ſuch a diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the one and other Chriſtians that can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be found out, diſcovers nothing but the hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs of the Souls ſin, in its neglect of union with Chriſt. Now from hence to conclude God intends no good to the Soul, is contrary to the bleſſed will of God revealed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. where God hath promiſed, <hi>abundantly to pardon, to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to pardon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard when the greateſt diſproportion between the one and other Chriſtians is found out, yet thou art one of thoſe that Jeſus Chriſt now comes to woo, and perſwade, and beſeech to be one with his Father.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall ſhew you the grounds of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper upon which it is built, or whence it ariſes in Souls.</p>
               <p n="1">I. It is commonly built upon this principle, That the Lord maintains a proportion in his Gifts and Graces unto his people. Now what a dark blind principle is this. For the clearing of it,</p>
               <p n="1">1. You muſt conceive, the Lord doth equally diſpenſe to all his peoples Souls all kind of Graces. He leaves ſuitable diſpoſitions in the Heart to yield obedience to all his bleſſed will: Thus far the Lord proportions Grace; but then the Lord doth not proportion the degrees of Grace.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In regard of the concord and agreement in the whole Body of Chriſt that is neceſſary to be attained. It is for the bettering of the union of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48673:119"/>
the Body of Chriſt, that Chriſtians have particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar different Graces, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.25, 26.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It it neceſſary to preſerve the beauty and comlineſs of the Body of Chriſt, that the whole Body ſhould be ſo compacted together, that one member ſhould not receive all the excellencies of the other members.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That there might be a full manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the abſolute freedom of God, in the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of all his Graces. The Lord will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have the glory of his free love, in diſpenſing Grace to whom he pleaſes, but the glory of his free Grace in diſpenſing it in what manner and degree he pleaſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the neceſſity of different degrees of Grace, ariſes a neceſſity of the diſpenſation of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Gifts.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond diſtemper upon which this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple doth ariſe is this, That the Soul doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there muſt be a large portion of Grace go before the Souls attaining unto the aſſurance of Faith, that he is united to the Lord Chriſt. And thence the Soul ſeeks into the Lives and Hearts of other Chriſtians, and meaſures himſelf by thoſe, thinking upon a ſight of a conformity in himſelf to them in their Graces and Duties; he might then proceed to the actings of Faith in a way of aſſurance, and then have ſome confidence of his union with Chriſt: And hence ſo long as the Soul conceives a defect in himſelf, in thoſe Graces he beholds to be in other Chriſtians, he ſits down diſcouraged from the exerciſe of Faith. That this alſo is a vile principle of darkneſs muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:48673:119"/>
made appear. Yet, firſt, for the clearing of it I muſt premiſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That the very act of Faith in a way of full aſſurance, of the Lords accepting the Soul to be one with him in Chriſt, is a moſt ſuperlative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That every Soul that attains unto that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Faith, to receive with a fulneſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, the Lords good will concerning his own Soul, to accept him to be one with him in the Lord Chriſt, doth attain a large portion of all kind of Graces alſo. There are the ſpecial workings of the love of God in the Spirit of holineſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is this aſſurance unto Faith of the Souls union with Chriſt. To make it clear,</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a large portion of knowledge. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of God is the mother of all vice, the very womb wherein unbelief is conceived withal its Brats, withal its ſcruples and objections what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. And according to the degree wherein that Ignorance of God is healed, ſo is the degree of the Souls attaining towards the aſſurance of Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a large portion of Spiritual life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in the Soul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a large portion of contentment in God and Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is a large portion of love to God in Jeſus Chriſt communicated to him. Love begets love, and according to the degree, wherein a Soul apprehends the love of God to his Soul in Chriſt; ſo is the anſwerable degree of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of love towards God in Chriſt again.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:48673:120"/>5. There is a large portion of raiſedneſs of Spirit, above all things below. I give but a taſte of the large portion of Grace, which of neceſſity muſt be in Souls where Faith of aſſurance is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. But now to ſpeak more directly to the principle it ſelf: notwithſtanding this, yet the principle it ſelf is a dark principle.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In regard there is no neceſſity of a large por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Grace, going before the Souls aſſurance of Faith, to prepare the Soul for aſſurance. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this ſence, that the habit of Grace prepares the Soul for the acting of Grace; ſo the habit of Faith is received before there be an act of Faith; and ſo a Soul may be ſaid to be prepared for aſſurance unto Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">II. There is no neceſſity of any large portions of Grace, to give the Soul any better ground to act Faith in fulneſs of aſſurance and confidence. The only ground of the Souls confidence of the Lords will, to accept his loveleſs Soul into union with Chriſt, is the Lords word, wherein he reveals that his bleſſed will: Now the Lords word ſpeaks as plainly, and reveals his will as clearly to the Soul, not having the leaſt portion of Grace to accept his loveleſs Soul into union with Chriſt, as it doth to thoſe that have the largeſt portion of Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">III. There is no neceſſity of any portion of Grace to make the actings of Faith of aſſurance to be the Souls duty. Even when a Soul is a rebel, when he is an enemy, the Lord doth as ſtrictly command him from Heaven, to give credit to his bleſſed Word, revealing his good will to accept his loveleſs Soul, if he will be one with him in
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:48673:120"/>
Chriſt, as he doth command the Soul to believe it, after the communication of all Grace.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Thoſe very portions of Grace, great or ſmall that are attained to, when the Soul hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance unto Faith, they are all attained through the Souls believing with that fulneſs of aſſurance. Faith is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of Sanctification, and of the whole work of Grace.</p>
               <p>The Sixth and laſt dark diſtemper is,<note place="margin">Dark di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</note> 
                  <hi>The Souls unconſtancy.</hi> This unconſtancy is of two kinds; the one in the thoughts and imaginations; the ſecond is the unconſtancy of the Souls determinations and concluſions. Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we are unſtable as water, ſeldom ſtay a moment in the ſame place. For the right underſtanding of this diſtemper there muſt be divers things opened.</p>
               <p n="1">I. We muſt know, it is not a ſtrict, cloſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable adherence to their determinations of truth, that are once drawn up in a Soul, that theſe commands require from any Soul; that may be as bad a diſtemper on the other hand. Therefore obſerve there are three caſes in which a Soul may be too much ſettled, and adhere too faſt to his own concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When the Soul ſticks faſt to any concluſion, without Spiritual divine light, compelling and conſtraining the Soul to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When a Soul is ſo taken with any determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he hath drawn up in his own Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning truth, that his own Spirit will not ſuffer him to take a right view of any thing that the Scripture ſeems to propound to the contrary.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:48673:121"/>3. When a Soul is ſo affected with any deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination drawn up in his own Spirit, that he hath a prejudicial opinion againſt whatever ſeems to contradict that his own determination.</p>
               <p n="2">II. You muſt know there are caſes wherein there muſt and ought to be alterations and changes, in a Souls own determination concerning Truth, and concerning the State of his own Soul. And thoſe caſes are eſpecially two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Where there is clearer evidence concerning the object conveyed into a Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When there is a clearer evidence in regard of the Soul it ſelf, which we commonly call a clearer evidence in regard of the ſubject. If a Soul through weakneſs of light received, conclude or determine of any thing concerning his Soul, then there muſt and ought to be a change of theſe determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when there is a clearer evidence come into his Soul.</p>
               <p n="3">III. There may lawfully be a ſuſpicion, and a jealouſie over it ſelf in regard of its own uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy. A Soul may have a holy fear of his own deceitful Heart, when he ſees it ſettled upon a concluſion, leſt it ſhould not be ſo rightly ſettled as God requires. There are two acts a Soul may do upon this ground.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He may be making a continual ſearch into the grounds of thoſe concluſions and determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are in his own Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Soul may and ought to draw up his Spirit unto God, and to bring his determinations into the preſence of God, and the ground of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations, and lay them all open before the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:48673:121"/>Now it muſt be opened, when a Soul is guilty of this ſad diſtemper of unconſtancy, in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations and reſolutions. There are three caſes wherein the Soul is guilty of this.</p>
               <p n="1">I. When the Soul remains wavering, in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed unſettled frame of Spirit, upon any deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination that it doth draw up within it ſelf. When a Soul apprehends reaſon on both ſides, and weight in both reaſons, and thereupon ſuffers his Soul to ſtand like Scales, with weights in both Scales al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in an equipoiſe, now turning this way, then that way, and ſtand ſteadfaſt no way: Now he conceives it is the will of God to accept his Soul into union with him, the next morning he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives no; ſurely it cannot be that God ſhould have a thought of kindneſs for ſuch a wretch as he. Yet do not miſtake here, for I muſt grant there may be ſuch an equipoiſed Spirit in Souls without ſin, ſo it be with theſe limitations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the truth of Chriſt concerning which the Soul remains in this wavering ſtate, be not a matter of duty that God requires from the Souls hands. Some truths are more Theoretical, ſome more Practical; now if it be not a practical truth that God requires from the Soul, it may not be ſin: But if it be a practical truth, concerning the Souls acting of Faith upon Jeſus Chriſt tendred, or the Souls worſhipping God in ſome ordinances of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual uſe; then though it be through weakneſs, and want of light, that the Soul is not able to have his Spirit ſettled upon a concluſion; yet I dare not excuſe the Soul from ſin, for I ſuppoſe no caſe can come, but the Soul is guilty of too much ignorance that he might have avoided, or guilty
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48673:122"/>
of unbelief that keeps his Spirit in the preſent caſe unſwayed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Take this limitation, That ſuch an unſettled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit concerning a truth, be after a Souls ſtrict endeavouring for a full ſatisfaction and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of his Spirit concerning that truth.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Soul is guilty of this inconſtancy, when the ſtrength of imagination only doth unſettle the Soul from any determination or concluſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that truth of Chriſt that he hath formerly drawn up in his own Spirit. The Devil hath a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret door into every Heart through the fancy; it is as it were the Devils back door, it is his ſecret ſally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port door that he comes out of, to fight againſt the Soul. The Devil ſteals into the Heart by the fancy, before ever the Soul is aware of it, without any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm, and by the working of the fancy he doth ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſtrange imaginations in the Soul, without ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting a ground and foundation, upon which ſuch imaginations are built.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Then a Soul is guilty of this ſad diſtemper, when it is unſettled and removed, from its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations and concluſions, with every juſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, without a juſt compariſon of the ſtrength of the objection, and the reaſoning of the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with the ſtrength of the reaſoning of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer perſwaſion and determination. This is that ſad diſtemper the Scripture ſpeaks of, <hi>To be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up and down with every wind of Doctrine, and to be ſoon ſhaken in mind,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.1, 2.</p>
               <p>Now the diſtemper being thus opened in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, you muſt note that there are three ſpecial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, in reference to the caſe in hand, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which a Soul becomes guilty of this diſtemper of unconſtancy.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:48673:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. That the tender of union with the Lord Jeſus, do reach to every particular Soul. The Devil and the corrupt Heart, ſtrive to maintain a conſtancy of Spirit in this determination, either keeping the Soul wavering here, not daring to reſolve this bleſſed Truth to be a Truth; or elſe in ſuggeſting ſtrong imaginations to keep the Soul from giving firm credit to that Truth, or by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up objection upon objection againſt that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Truth, that the Heart may not be ſettled upon that concluſion; but if it be ſettled upon it in the evening, if poſſible, it ſhall be removed in the morning.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That no wickedneſs, wretchedneſs, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate vileneſs that can be imagined, is any impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment to the Lords acceptance of the Soul into union with the Lord Jeſus. All the ſtrength of reaſoning, that the Machiavilian brains of Hell can produce, ſhall be brought to evade this Truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it is the duty of every particular Soul, immediately and at all times, without the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, to give credit to the Lord, and believe that he is willing to accept that particular loveleſs Soul into union with Chriſt. Theſe pretious Truths, being that pretious heavenly Chriſtal glaſs, through which the Spiritual eye comes to diſcern the very Heart of God towards it in Chriſt; if it be poſſible that either the power or policy of Hell can foment that diſtemper in the Heart concerning this principle, to prevent the Soul from ſettling a full concluſion in this particular, it ſhall be effected.</p>
               <p>Now this diſtemper prevents the Souls evidence of union with Chriſt from the promiſes, by theſe five ſeveral effects that it hath upon the Heart.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:48673:123"/>I. It prevents the Soul of the injoyment of a ſufficient time, to diſcern the inward of the Lords promiſe, of accepting a Soul into union with Chriſt, even when he doth behold the promiſe. There are four things that a Soul muſt diſcern in a promiſe, in reference to the diſcerning of his union with Chriſt from the promiſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Soul muſt diſcern the largeneſs of the extent of that promiſe, of acceptance of a Soul into union with Chriſt. He muſt diſcern the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of the promiſe to be ſo wide as to take in his own particular Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Soul muſt diſcern the infinite freedom of God in the tendering of the promiſe, to accept the Soul into union with Chriſt. It muſt ſee that God requires nothing, either to prepare or diſpoſe the Soul aright, for the injoyment of the promiſe, or to give the Soul a right and title to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Soul muſt ſee the very bowels of the mercies of Jeſus Chriſt in the promiſes. It is the ſight of the readineſs of the Heart of Chriſt, to embrace the loveleſs Soul, that makes the bowels of the Soul yern towards Chriſt again.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Soul muſt diſcern the ſufficiency of the promiſe, to aſſure the Soul of what it longs after. Now it being of neceſſity that all theſe muſt be diſcerned, in the promiſes of acceptance of the Soul into union with Chriſt, before the Soul can be ſatisfied from the promiſes that he is united to Jeſus Chriſt; an hours view, or a days view, in an ordinary way I mean (unleſs the Spirit caſt in ſuperlative light extraordinary) will not ſuffice a Soul to diſcern all theſe through the promiſe.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:48673:123"/>II. This inconſtancy in the Souls reſolutions, expoſes the Soul to the violence of all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This will appear in three things,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard the ſword of the Spirit to fight againſt the Temptations with, is made void. <hi>The ſword of the Spirit is the pretious word of God,</hi> Eph. 6.17. Now the Soul being unſettled in his own determinations, concerning the truth of the Word of God to his own Soul in particular, he hath no pretious uſe of that pretious ſword, the Word of God, to reſiſt the tempter with.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The habit of Faith is weakned. I mean, the readineſs of the diſpoſition of Faith to be in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, is in a great meaſure hindred: The Heart is more indiſpoſed to the exerciſe of Faith, by how much the ſeldomer Faith is drawn out to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Carnal reaſonings of the Heart grow ſtrong. The more any corruption prevails, the more ſtrength it gets: Sin is never decrepit, the older it grows the ſtronger it grows. Thus carnal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning of the Heart growing old, by the conſtant prevailing over the Soul, it grows ſtronger. All theſe concurring, a Soul is in a dreadful meaſure expoſed to the tyranny of all Temptations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Temptations that batter down the hopes of Election.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Temptations unto ſlaviſh fear, and dread and horrour of execution of preſent ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A Soul is expoſed to the power and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of that temptation, that it is wicked abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable preſumption for his wretched Soul to have a thought that God will be willing to accept him in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:48673:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>III. Through that inconſtancy, the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is provoked to tempt. It is obſerved in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the rule the Lord gives concerning our fighting with Satan is <hi>to reſiſt,</hi> and the rule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning fighting with ſin <hi>is fleeing,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.9. Now it is thought it is upon this occaſion the Lord gives this rule, becauſe fleeing gives the Devil advantage, and makes him more violent in his temptations. There is nothing that gives the Devil diſcouragement in tempting, but a ſight of an impoſſibility of prevailing.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The inconſtancy of the Soul in theſe reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and determinations, prevents the increaſe and growth of all the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt. You ſhall obſerve in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. That the Holy Ghoſt urging the Saints to grow in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, he gives them an admonition to take heed they fall not from their own ſteadfaſtneſs; intimating thus much, while their Souls remain unſtable, in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and giving credit to thoſe pretious Truths of Chriſt that were revealed, there could be no growth in the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">V. This inconſtancy of the Soul, doth leave it like a loſt one in a meer wilderneſs. It leaves it wandering in devious paths it knows not whither. When the Judgment of the Soul is thus unſtable, concerning thoſe pretious principles forenamed, the Soul is left without a Pilot, without a Compaſs; ſo that the Soul knows not how to ſteer its courſe to the pretious haven of happineſs. So that this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper muſt be healed, before the Soul can diſcern its union with Chriſt. Now the Spirit heals this diſtemper two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:48673:124"/>1. By vouchſafing a clear and full manifeſtation to the Soul, of thoſe pretious forenamed princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, by caſting in ſuch a high degree of divine light, as makes the truth of thoſe forenamed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions out of queſtion. It is according to the evidence the Soul receives of a truth, that the judgment is ſettled either more or leſs firmly upon it. Now the Spirit doth ſo manifeſt thoſe preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Truths, and ſo clears the Eye, as it ſeeth them without ſcruple, and then the Judgment begins to be ſettled with ſome firmneſs upon them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit heals it by a continuation of the firſt manifeſtation of thoſe Truths. So that a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of evidence of the Truth that the Soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes upon, remaining in the Soul, the Soul remains in a fixed ſettled way, cleaving and ſticking to thoſe Truths ſo concluded upon. Now thus you have the ſecond work of the Spirit, in that firſt general effect of it upon the Heart opened, which is the removal of all impediments that hinder di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine light; and you have ſeen what beams of the principles of darkneſs, and alſo what dark di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers are pulled out, before the Soul is fit to diſcern the light of Jeſus Chriſt held forth.</p>
               <p>Now the third work of the Spirit in this illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, is the Spirits acting by its own power, the Divine light communicated to the Soul. It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary not only that a Soul receive a faculty from the Spirit, but alſo the acting of the faculty too: Though all acts of the renewed man, be firmly the acts of the Mind, yet they are originally the acts of the Spirit it ſelf. So that alſo in this caſe concerning illumination, there is a neceſſity not only that the Soul hath a ſeeing Eye, but that it
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48673:125"/>
muſt alſo have the ſeeing of the Eye from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Though the Soul hath an Eye diſpoſed to ſee the divine light that the promiſe diſcovers, yet there muſt come in a power from the Spirit alſo, whereby the Soul may be inabled to act that very power received. As it is in the cleared Eye, it hath a fitneſs to ſee any colour, but it muſt be acted by the rational Soul, otherwiſe the inward diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Soul effects nothing; thats the reaſon the Eye ſees not in ſleep, becauſe the rational Soul is bound up as it were in its operations: Thus it is with the divine man, though influences be communicated from Jeſus Chriſt to the Soul, that the Soul hath a ſpiritual Eye, rightly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſee ſpiritual objects, yet there muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Spirits power to act that very Eye, that is ſo diſpoſed to ſee the ſpiritual object. So that thus the Spirit comes in by a renewed power, and as it were blows up thoſe holy ſparks of divine light, that are communicated to the Soul, and makes them to work in their own proper natural way, to make them ſee that pretious divine light, that the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Lord diſcover to the poor dark Soul.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the firſt work, or the firſt effect, that the Spirit of God hath upon Souls, towards the revealing to them from the promiſe, that they are united to the Lord Jeſus.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Spirits Irradiation.</note>II. We are now to proceed to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond work of the Spirit upon Souls, in the evidencing to them from the promiſes their union with Chriſt, and that is the manifeſtation, or Irradiation of the promiſe it ſelf, or of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. There are two ways how the Spirit doth reveal any thing to a Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:48673:125"/>The 1. is by infuſing of divine light. The 2d. is by manifeſting the object to that divine light. It is not ſufficient light communicated to the faculty of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, that inables it to diſcern a thing preſently, but there muſt be alſo an enlightning, and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the object to be diſcovered, unto that light communicated. The moſt acute Eye that is, of the greateſt perſpicuity and clearneſs, can diſcern no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing any further then the things themſelves are preſented to them. So that the Spirit in evidencing to the Soul from the promiſes, muſt caſt as it were beams of light, ſome kind of holy rays from the promiſe it ſelf upon the Eye, as well as light into the Eye, to diſcern the light that is caſt upon the Eye. Thats the reaſon, that a Soul at one time ſhall diſcern the very Heart of Chriſt towards him in the promiſes, or in the Goſpel; and at another time looking upon the ſame Word, the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, with the ſame diligence, and yet it not ſo much as giveth a ſufficient ground for an imperfect hope, or an act of Faith in way of adherence, and this is from a different manifeſtation of this Irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of the Spirit unto the Soul. Now this mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation, or Irradiation doth conſiſt in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Spirit preſents the Goſpel, or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to the Soul. <hi>We are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.5. There muſt be as well an application of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Eye, as an application of the Eye to the object, and yet both muſt be alſo by the Spirit of God: Therefore, <hi>John</hi> 14.26. it is put as a part of the office of the comforting Spirit, or the evidencing Spirit, to bring the pretious things that Chriſt had ſpoken to his Diſciples to their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance again.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:48673:126"/>2. The Spirit doth evidence the promiſe, or the Goſpel, that it hath preſented to the Eye. It brings it to remembrance and then opens it, and reveals the very nature and intent of it. You muſt conceive there is a twofold evidence of things; there is an evidence of narration, and an evidence of the matter it ſelf: Now the Goſpel is always evident in matter of narration, that is, as ſpoken from the mouth of God in his written Word: But the Goſpel is very inevident in regard of the matter, or of the thing it ſelf; it is an hidden myſtery, ſo dark a riddle as cannot be found out, without the help of the Spirit it ſelf: Now though the evidence only of narration of the Goſpel, be ſufficient to excite the Soul to act Faith by way of adherence and recumbency up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, yet it is not ſufficient to excite the Soul to act Faith by way of aſſurance. Divers things there are in the promiſe, or in the Goſpel, that the Spirit doth evidence to the Soul, when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing its union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Firſt beam of divine light.</note>Firſt, It preſents and evidenceth to the Soul, the Lord Chriſt fully, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably, and everlaſtingly, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away all ſin and wickedneſs, from every Soul that ſhall embrace him. You ſhall obſerve, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. that it was through the knowledge of this, that the Faith of <hi>Paul</hi> took wing firſt, to mount above in a tryumphant way: ſaith he, <hi>what ſhall we ſay to theſe things?</hi> What things? Things that he had before ſpoken of in the beginning of the Epiſtle, eſpecially <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. where he had made it appear clearly, <hi>That where ſin did abound, grace did much more abound,</hi> ſuper-abound,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48673:126"/>
abound without meaſure, in that Grace did triumph over ſin through Jeſus Chriſt: Now, ſaith he, <hi>what ſhall we ſay to theſe things?</hi> He ſtood in admiration at the thoughts of it, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſay, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect?</hi> Here Faith began to triumph from the knowledge of Chriſts compleat removal of all ſin, from every Soul that did embrace him. Now the Spirit evidenceth divers things to the Soul, for the clearing of this.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The Spirit makes it evident that the Lord Chriſt took upon him to be ſurety for every Soul that would embrace him. <hi>He became the ſurety of the new Covenant,</hi> Heb. 7.22. The Spirit makes the Soul diſcern that Chriſt ſtept into his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to undertake to be bound to pay all the debts, for every Soul that ſhall hereafter embrace him. And herein the Spirit is wont to evidence two things concerning the ſuretyſhip of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Chriſt undertook to be a ſurety of the whole Covenant for Souls. That he undertook to fulfil all that Juſtice or Mercy it ſelf ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, to be fulfilled, for thoſe Souls for whom he undertook.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he became ſuch a ſurety, as he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to pay the debt alone. Hence, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.8. he is called <hi>the Covenant it ſelf:</hi> Intimating that the whole Covenant concerning taking away ſin, is only between God the Father and Jeſus Chriſt: Hence it is ſaid, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>God was in Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the World unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. The Spirit evidenceth, that Chriſt as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour ſtood in the relation of a common perſon,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48673:127"/>
and took upon him to repreſent all the perſons of thoſe, <hi>that ſhould hereafter believe on him;</hi> ſo that whatever ſatisfaction he ſhould give to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers juſtice in regard of ſin, ſhould be not only in ſtead of ſatisfaction to be given to the Father by the Souls themſelves; but alſo to be done as it were in their ſtead to be accounted as if they themſelves had given ſatisfaction. This the Spirit may evidence from the promiſe, from ſome ſuch place, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.48. which ſhews that Jeſus Chriſt ſtood as a common perſon in ſtead of all thoſe that ſhould believe on him; as <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt man ſtood as a common perſon, to repreſent all thoſe that ſhould come out of him: Or from ſuch a place as that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. where the old <hi>Adam</hi> is called a Type of Jeſus Chriſt that was to come.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing the Spirit clears, is the things themſelves done by Jeſus Chriſt in thoſe relations unto Souls, as he ſtood as a common perſon, and as the ſurety for thoſe that ſhould hereafter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Therein the Spirit cometh to clear the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Blood of Chriſt, <hi>the offering himſelf by death as a ſacrifice for ſin.</hi> Thence you ſhall obſerve, the firſt thing <hi>Paul</hi> inſtanceth in, when he lets his Faith look upon the removing of all Sin, is Chriſt dying; ſaith he in a holy Triumph of Faith, <hi>who ſhall condemn?</hi> Why? <hi>Chriſt hath dyed;</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, how ſhall either carnal reaſon, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or unbelief, or Juſtice, or Law, or Hell, or Devil, bring any accuſation againſt our Souls, ſeeing Jeſus Chriſt hath died; <hi>he hath offered up himſelf by death as a propitiatory ſacrifice for ſin,</hi> out of a purpoſe and intent fully to take away
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48673:127"/>
the ſins of all thoſe that ſhall believe on him: Hence the Spirit evidenceth ſuch a place as that, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He hath made him to be ſin for us, that knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him:</hi> That we might have remiſſion of ſins, and that juſtification that God had prepared for Souls by him: Or ſuch a place as that in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all men to be received, that Jeſus Chriſt came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chieſ;</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt undertook to be humbled ſo deeply, to vail the brightneſs of his own glory in ſuch obſcurity, as to come down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the World, to take away the ſins of poor periſhing wretches. Now in the Spirits evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing this fulneſs of ſatisfaction, it ordinarily evidenceth theſe things, for the ſatisfying Faith ſo fully as it may work by way of aſſurance, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of confidence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It evidenceth the full ſatisfaction of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his death, in regard it was the Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker himſelf that was ſubject to the Law, and made under the power of the Law, to ſatisfie for the tranſgreſſion of the Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard the brightneſs of the Fathers glory was debaſed by Chriſts debaſement, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the debaſement of the Fathers glory, that was by the tranſgreſſion of the Law. What can conſcience or carnal reaſon ſay more concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the nature of ſin, and the height of its merit; but only that it is a debaſement of the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, it is a vailing and eclipſing of the higheſt Majeſty of Heaven, it is a bringing a cloud as it were, over thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48673:128"/>
unſpotted beams of the Lords excellency, over the Lords high Soveraignty in commanding Souls, and over Gods holineſs and equity in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, and therefore the merit of ſin is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. Now the Spirit can anſwer by evidencing to the Death of Chriſt, a fulneſs of ſatisfaction, in regard it was Jeſus Chriſt that was debaſed; he that was the expreſs image of his Father, the lively pattern of his Fathers glory; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spirit evidenceth from the Goſpel that God himſelf ſpeaks in a way, as if he were more than ſatisfied, as if Grace through Chriſt did tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over ſin: According to that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. <hi>If by one mans offence death reigned by one, much more they which have received abundance of Grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſs, ſhall reign in life by one Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Much more they which receive, that is, they that partake of the merit of the death of Chriſt, much more ſhall they reign: As if there were a higher degree of equity that ſuch ſhould reign, then there was that ſuch Souls, that were before under ſin, ſhould die. So <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. <hi>The grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant,</hi> the word is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>was more than enough.</hi> There was more than a ſufficiency of Grace through Jeſus Chriſt, ſtill ſpeaking as if God had ſo ſatisfied himſelf, through the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the death of Chriſt for ſin, that he had ſatisfaction, as it were, over and over again.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In that it was the Godhead it ſelf cloathed in fleſh, that gave the ſatisfaction. Now herein the Spirit evidenceth a fulneſs, and abundance of ſufficiency of ſatisfaction, in regard there is a higher worth upon the ſatisfaction to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:48673:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from the Godhead cloathed in the fleſh, then there could be evil by offending of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head that was done by man: The Godhead was only the object againſt whom the ſin was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but in the ſatisfaction, the Godhead it ſelf cloathed in the fleſh became the ſubject, from whom the ſatisfaction is given, as well as to whom the ſatisfaction is given; ſo as the ſatisfaction doth in a manner, in the worth and height of it, tranſcend and go beyond the height of the offence, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction going from a higher ſubject, a more ſubject, than the offence was committed by.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In regard of the full weight of ſin, that Jeſus Chriſt bore in his giving full ſatisfaction to the Father. He died under the reputation of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt of ſinners that can be imagined, and though this was unjuſt in regard of men that did ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute him, yet not in regard of God who had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that the iniquities of all that ſhould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him, ſhould be laid upon him: And indeed their iniquities were laid upon him to the higheſt, if you conſider under what notion of ſin he died; he died under the notion of a Traytor to his own Prince, as one that took pleaſure in all kind of ſin, a friend of publicans and ſinners, as they reputed him: he died as a wretched blaſphemer of the moſt high God, as one that did ſtrike at the Throne of God, to dethrone God himſelf, and he died as an impoſture, as a vile ſeducer: Nay more, he died under the notion of a Devil, yea the Prince of Devils, they ſay of him that by <hi>Belzebub</hi> the Prince of Devils, he caſt out Devils: Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Spirit evidenceth a fulneſs of ſatisfaction to the Father, in the Death of Chriſt, in regard
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48673:129"/>
Chriſt who is holineſs it ſelf, who was the ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Lamb without the leaſt blemiſh, that he ſhould take upon him to be accounted, and ſo to ſuffer, as the higheſt kind of ſinner that can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be imagined. The Spirit can evidence here clearly, a ſufficiency and fulneſs of ſatisfaction, for the ſin of every Soul that ſhall embrace him, whatever Conſcience can object againſt the Soul, ſeeing Conſcience cannot object a higher kind of wickedneſs than was laid upon the back of Chriſt as a ſurety.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In regard the Lord Chriſt took a fulneſs of pleaſure and contentment in bearing the Juſtice of the Father, executed upon him as a ſinner. Juſtice receiveth ſatisfaction, when its ſentence is execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fully againſt any tranſgreſſor, that it paſſeth ſentence againſt; and thus Juſtice was ſatisfied through the Death of Chriſt: But there is a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction as it were over and above, when the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Juſtice paſt out againſt a tranſgreſſor, is not only executed upon the transgreſſor, or him that ſtands in ſtead of the tranſgreſſor; but the ſentence is received with delight, pleaſure and contentment: Now thus Jeſus Chriſt through his Death gave fulneſs of ſatisfaction, in that it was the pleaſure of his Soul to bear the determined will of his Father for ſinners in this way: ſaith he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8. <hi>Lo I come to do thy will, my God,</hi> expreſſing the readineſs and willingneſs of his Heart to beat that will of his Father for ſinners: Nay ſo great was his delight in bearing the ſentence of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice paſt upon him, as he ſtood as a tranſgreſſor and ſinner, that he ſaith himſelf <hi>be was even ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned till it be accompliſhed,</hi> Luke 12.50.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:48673:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>Now as the Spirit evidenceth by the effuſion of Chriſt's Blood, a ſatisfaction given to the Father: So ſecondly, it evidenceth the ſutableneſs of the ſatisfaction, and that in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of the things ſuffered by Chriſt to give ſatisfaction: Thoſe things every way ſutable to what Juſtice could require, from the Soul it ſelf, in regard of his ſin. Two things ſin declareth the Soul hath merited to ſuffer for ever.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Death of the Body wherein ſin is act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and committed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Death of the Soul it ſelf, in the ſeparation of it from God, which was the chief actor in the transgreſſion of the Law. Now the Spirit evidences the Death of Chriſt a ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſatisfaction in regard of the things ſuffered by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In regard the humane Body died, that ſtood in the ſtead of thoſe that had been the tranſgreſſors of the Law: he took upon him fleſh, and ſo died for ſin in the fleſh, in the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the ſame kind of Body that ſin was acted in.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In that there was a ſeparation of the Soul of Chriſt from injoyment of communion with his Father: as appears, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.46. <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> That is, why haſt thou deprived me of communion with thee? And though indeed the ſeparation was not eternal, yet in regard of the perſon bearing the ſeparation, it was equivalent to an eternal ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: One moment of ſeparation was as great an evil inflicted upon ſuch a perſon, as an eternal ſeparation could have been to have been
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48673:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
inflicted upon a poor finite Creature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit evidenceth the ſutableneſs of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the Father, in regard of the ſins them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves laid to the charge of Chriſt, in his ſuffering what Juſtice could require ſhould be ſuffered by the transgreſſor; and that both in the kind of ſin, and alſo in the degree of ſin, yea and alſo in the circumſtance of ſin too. That which was equivalent to all kind of ſin, was imputed to Chriſt to be ſuffered, that ſhould have been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by tranſgreſſors: Apoſtacy from God was imputed to him, by being imputed to be a Devil: Enmity to God in the higheſt degree was imputed to him, in that he was imputed the Prince of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils: All kind of fighting againſt God was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him, in that he was imputed a Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and a ſtriver to ſit down in the Throne of God himſelf, and an impoſtor and deceiver. So that no kind of ſin, that Conſcience can object againſt the Soul, but the Spirit can and doth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at ſuch a time was imputed to Chriſt, and Chriſt ſuffered for ſuch a ſin that was equivalent to that kind of ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">II. In the Spirits evidencing the Lord Chriſt to have fully and everlaſtingly taken away all the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs of what kind ſoever from every Soul that ſhall embrace him, it evidenceth the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the Dead. This is clear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>It is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again.</hi> In this the Spirit evidenceth three things to the Soul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It evidenceth the Fathers acknowledgment of his own ſatisfaction for the ſins of all the perſons that ſhould ever embrace Chriſt and believe on
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48673:130"/>
him. The Spirit evidenceth to the Soul, <hi>Chriſt having once taken upon him, as a ſurety, to bear the tranſgreſſions of all that ſhould believe on him;</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving entred into Bond to pay all their debts, and ſuffered himſelf to be arreſted by the Juſtice of God; yea to be carried to the priſon of the Grave by the Hand of Juſtice for thoſe tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, he muſt never have come out till he had paid the uttermoſt farthing: And that's the reaſon that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.14. the Apoſtle tells them, <hi>That their Faith is vain, and their Preaching of Chriſt is vain, unleſs Chriſt be riſen:</hi> Whence the Apoſtle noteth, <hi>That though the Death of Jeſus Chriſt, was the matter of ſattisfaction to the Juſtice of the Father, for the Juſtifying of all the perſons that Chriſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained;</hi> yet there is no evidence unto Faith, that God the Father is ſatisfied, for thoſe transgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by the Death of Chriſt, unleſs Chriſt be riſen.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit evidenceth to the Soul Chriſts own triumphant victory over ſin, and all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants and conſequents of ſin. Now therein the Spirit evidenceth Chriſts removal of all kind of ſin, from every Soul that ſhall hereafter embrace him, in regard he hath now captivated ſin, he hath got ſin under his own power, to trample under his Feet, and to do with as he pleaſe; he hath taken ſin and tied it to his Chariot wheel, as the word imports.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Spirit doth evidence in and from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, as he was a ſurety, that the Lord doth account his acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance given to Jeſus Chriſt for ſin, that was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon him, to be an acquittance of all thoſe
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48673:131"/>
that ever ſhould embrace Chriſt through believing; and alſo that Chriſt in receiving that acquittance from God, did receive it in the room, and in the ſtead of all that ever ſhould embrace him. And thence the Spirit evidenceth to the Soul, that the Scripture attributes unto every believer, a partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the reſurrection of Chriſt, yea that it attributes to them a Co-reſurrection with Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13. <hi>You being dead in your ſins, hath he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together with him;</hi> that is, hath made you par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the vertue of his reſurrection, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed you with himſelf; and <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>Blotting out the hand writing of Ordinances that was againſt us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his croſs;</hi> that is, Juſtifying our Souls from all that ever Sin, Conſcience, the Law, or the Devil could bring againſt us.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The Spirit evidenceth to the Soul, the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of Jeſus Chriſt to the right Hand of the Father, as he was a ſurety, and as he did repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſinners that ſhould receive him to be their Mediator. Thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Paul</hi> through the Spirits manifeſtation of Jeſus Chriſt at the right Hand of the Father, had ſuch a full evidence, as he could make a challenge to the Law, and to Sin, and Hell, and the Devil, to bring all their accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſee if they could lay any thing to his charge: <hi>Who ſhall condemn?</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is gone to the right Hand of the Father.</hi> Now from Chriſt's Aſcenſion to the right Hand of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Spirit is wont to evidence theſe four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Lord Chriſt as a ſurety for all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that ſhould embrace him as their Mediator,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48673:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath now received an acknowledgment in Heaven, that he hath fully taken away all the ſins of all that ever ſo receive him. The Spirit brings to the Souls remembrance what welcom, as it were, Jeſus Chriſt had into Heaven: It ſhews the Soul from ſuch a place as that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. The Father ſaid to Chriſt when he came into Heaven, <hi>Well done thou obedient Son, ſit thou down at my right Hand.</hi> There are two things obſervable in that.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In that welcom given by the Father, there is an evidence that the Father acknowledgeth the work by Chriſt to be fully done. Sitting imports a reſt after a work fulfilled, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Spirit evidenceth that high fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that Jeſus Chriſt had in Heaven, as he was a ſurety for thoſe ſinners that ſhould embrace him to be their Mediator, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit evidenceth from Chriſts Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he as a ſurety for all thoſe ſinners that ſhould embrace him, hath fully prepared Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Now this Spirit evidenceth by two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the very end of the Aſcenſion of Jeſus Chriſt into Heaven, to ſit at the right Hand of the Father, was to prepare places in Heaven for all that ſhould embrace him, <hi>John</hi> 14.2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That Jeſus Chriſt is gone to Heaven as a fore-runner of thoſe that ſhould embrace him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.20. Now a fore-runner implys many fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Spirit evidenceth from Chriſts Aſcenſion, that he hath a Soveraignty, and Supremacy of all power committed to him. This Chriſt himſelf hints, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.64. <hi>Hereafter ſhall you ſee the Son
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48673:132"/>
of man ſit at the right Hand of power.</hi> That is, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in the higheſt power. So <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.20, 21. And thence in two things the Spirit evidenceth the Lord Chriſts taking away all kind of ſin from the Soul.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Spirit evidenceth that Chriſt hath ſuch a ſupremacy of power over all things, that it is impoſſible that the power of ſins guilt ſhould prevail againſt any for whom Jeſus Chriſt hath undertaken, ſeeing he hath the keys of Hell and of Death, and hath all things under his Feet in a vaſſalage to him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Spirit evidenceth to this ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of Chriſt as Mediator, that the Lord was well pleaſed with him as a ſurety, for ſuch Souls as ſhould embrace him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From the aſcenſion of Jeſus Chriſt to the right Hand of God, the Spirit evidenceth that the Lord Chriſt had the higheſt authority of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment committed to him. Sitting is the poſture of Judges, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.8. and <hi>John</hi> 5.21, 22. <hi>The Father hath committed all Judgement unto the Son.</hi> Thence in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.21, 22. he is ſaid <hi>to have all things put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Feet, and was given to be Head of all things to the Church.</hi> Now from hence the Spirit evidenceth by two things, the Lords full compleat taking away all ſin, from every Soul that ſhall embrace him.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In that no Judgment of condemnation can be paſſed upon ſuch a Soul, but what Judgment Chriſt as ſurety paſſeth, ſeeing all Judgement was committed to him as the Son, and as Mediator. And what can be more ſure than that all ſin and guilt ſhall be compleatly removed, ſeeing the Son
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48673:132"/>
himſelf that is the ſurety for Souls, muſt paſs the Judgment concerning all guilt that muſt be imputed to lie upon Souls.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In that no Judgment of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or guilt, can paſs againſt thoſe Souls that ſhall embrace him as their Mediator, but what ſhall paſs againſt themſelves. The Spirit manifeſts that whoever embraces Chriſt, muſt be intereſſed in every ſentence of Judgment that paſs out; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Judgment that Chriſt paſſeth as he is the ſurety of Souls, and repreſents them, it muſt paſs out in their names, even with their votes: So that no Judgment of condemnation for guilt can paſs out againſt them without their joynt vote and conſent.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The Spirit evidenceth the interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt with the Father, for all thoſe Souls that ſhall embrace him. Therefore in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. the Apoſtle proceeds to that ſtep, <hi>Who ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn? It is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again, that ſitteth at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us.</hi> Now in the Spirits mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting this, it doth manifeſt divers things for the ſatisfying of the Soul, for the full and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taking away all ſins by Chriſt, for every Soul that ſhall embrace him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the Spirits evidencing the interceſſion of Chriſt for ſinners with the Father, it doth evidence the Lord Chriſt to be a Son to the Father, and to plead as a Son with the Father for ſinners. This you ſhall ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. compared with <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. he tells you, <hi>he is able to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come unto God by him;</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. he puts an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis upon it, <hi>that he was a Son.</hi> This the Spirit
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48673:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>
commonly reveals to Souls in drawing them to Faith of aſſurance, that Jeſus Chriſt as the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Son of God intercedeth in Heaven for Souls. Now from thence there are two evidences given to a Soul, of Chriſts fully taking away ſin from every Soul that ſhall embrace him.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Spirit evidenceth, that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any guilt whatever ſhould cleave to the Soul, in regard the Son can ask nothing but what the Father will. <hi>The Father and I am one,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; ſo their wills are one, and their thoughts and diſpoſitions one.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Spirit evidencing that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the pleading of Jeſus Chriſt to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. There is ſuch a complacency, and acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of delight of the Father in Jeſus Chriſt, that the Father hath no more power to deny what the Lord Chriſt pleadeth for, then he hath power to deny himſelf, and that is impoſſible.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit evidenceth the interceſſion of Chriſt, doth evidence that the Lord Chriſt pleads with the Father as an obedient Son to his Fathers will. Now from this the Holy Ghoſt evidenceth in two things, the full, compleat, everlaſting ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of ſin from every Soul that ſhall em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Spirit evidenceth that there is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon the Father, to accept his Sons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty for poor ſinners.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Spirit evidenceth, that it was the fulfilling the ſame will of the Father that Jeſus Chriſt pleaded for, when he pleaded for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of the ſins of thoſe that embrace him. It was his Fathers deſign originally out of his love
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:48673:133"/>
to poor loſt wretches, to take away their ſins, only it was his purpoſe to effect it through Jeſus Chriſt, doing and ſatisfying his Juſtice for ſin: So that Jeſus Chriſt in yielding obedience unto his Father unto Death, did it to effect the end of his Father in the pardon of the ſins of loſt ſinners.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Spirit evidenceth in this interceſſion of Chriſt, that though he died as a common perſon, and roſe as a common perſon; yet he doth not intercede as a common perſon, not in their ſteads, but for them. That you ſhall obſerve <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. with <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. <hi>He was made the ſurety of the new Covenant, verſ.</hi> 22. And then he tells you, <hi>He is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, all that come unto God by him.</hi> There are two things the Spirit evidenceth in that.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It evidenceth that he pleaded as a ſurety appointed by his Father for Souls: According to <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.5. he did not glorifie himſelf to be made an high Prieſt, but he that ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.</hi> His Father or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained him to the office of an high Prieſt, which contains the ſuretiſhip.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He pleads as a ſurety to his Father to accompliſh the full ſalvation of Souls through his pleading. The Father ordained him <hi>to be a Prieſt for ever after the order of</hi> Melchiſedek; hence he, <hi>as an high Prieſt, is able to ſave to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt all that come unto God by him.</hi> Then the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit reveals the things done by Chriſt in his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion as a ſurety. Two things there the Spirit reveals.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That by Chriſts interceſſion as a ſurety for Souls, there is a vertual continuation of the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:48673:134"/>
ſacrifice of the Blood of Chriſt, for the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Fathers Juſtice. Now from thence the Spirit brings in full evidence for taking away all ſin, from every Soul that ſhall embrace Chriſt, in regard the ſatisfaction is continued in the Fathers Eye. Thence it is obſervable, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. comparing <hi>verſ.</hi> 2, 3. with <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. That the Apoſtle from the meditation of the continued Prieſthood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, miniſtring in Heaven, doth conclude the firmneſs and ſtability of the new Covenant, there mentioned in the latter end of the Chapter, and concludes from thence Gods <hi>remembrance of ſins and Iniquities no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Spirit evidenceth, that through Chriſts interceding as a ſurety, there is a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſuing out of the benefit of the ſatisfaction of the Father by his death, for ſinful Souls according to their neceſſities. Hence you may obſerve in 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1. That the Apoſtle directs thoſe belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that ſhould ſin, <hi>to be acting of Faith upon Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as he was a preſent advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Spirit manifeſts to the Soul's Faith, from that beam of light in the Goſpel, that the Lord hath everlaſtingly removed all ſin from all that ſhall embrace him; That the Lord Chriſt in his interceſſion with the Father, for the perfect Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of thoſe that ſhall embrace him, doth plead for nothing but what the Father himſelf, and of himſelf, is as willing to give to thoſe Souls, as Jeſus Chriſt is willing to ask it at his Fathers Hand. Therefore in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. The whole work of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation that Jeſus Chriſt was to accompliſh for Souls, is called nothing elſe but the Fathers plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48673:134"/>
                  <hi>The pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his Hands:</hi> Now this the Spirit clears up convincingly and ſatisfyingly, that the Father is altogether rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yea that the Fathers bowels do as much yern after the full Salvation of thoſe that embrace the Lord Jeſus, as the bowels of Chriſt himſelf, who is the Head of thoſe Souls. Now the Spirit may, and doth ſometimes evidence this parallel willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Father in theſe three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Spirit clears it that an amity and oneneſs comprehends all kind of near relation in it, and manifeſts that thoſe that embrace Chriſt, are admitted into unity with the Father himſelf, to be one with the Father. According to that in <hi>John</hi> 17.21, 22. <hi>That they may be one, as thou and I are one, and that they may be one in us, as thou Father art in me and I in thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Spirit may evidence, that the relation between the Father and Souls, is the very foundation of all relation between Chriſt and thoſe Souls. And therefore there muſt needs be as great willingneſs in the Father, to accept Chriſts pleading for perfect Salvation, as there is in Chriſt to plead for it: So that though Chriſt have thoſe that embrace him, ingraven as it were upon his Heart, yet it was there ingraven by the Hand of his Fathers love, <hi>John</hi> 17.6. <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me:</hi> They were made mine becauſe they were firſt thine.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Spirit may manifeſt here, that the willingneſs of Chriſt to plead for them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the willingneſs of the Father that he ſhould ſo plead, that he ſhould become an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor. Chriſt in all his pleadings is but a Prieſt,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:48673:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which Prieſthood is but an office to which God the Father had ordained him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.5.</p>
               <p>. The Spirit evidenceth that Chriſt in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion with the Father, for the perfect Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe Souls that ſhall embrace him, pleads for nothing but what he hath power to command to be effected. As in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6, 7. <hi>He hath ſet his King upon the holy hill;</hi> that is, as he that God the Father hath appointed in his own ſtead and room as Mediator, to diſpence all things communicable, to diſpoſe of all according to his will, only God the Father will be acknowledged as a Father to him, and he to be a Son; therefore the Lord ſaith in the next verſe, <hi>Ask of me, and I will give thee,</hi> it ſhall be by interceſſion: yet <hi>John</hi> 5.22. <hi>All judgment is committed to the Son</hi> ſtill, and he hath the power and command of all: Therefore you ſhall read, <hi>John</hi> 17.24. in that prayer that is the pattern of his interceſſion in Heaven for Souls; he prays thus, <hi>Father I will that thoſe that thou haſt given me be with me;</hi> he prays as it were in a commanding way.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Second beam of Divine Light.</note>There is a Second beam of the ſame Spiritual Heavenly light, that the Spirit doth neceſſarily alſo cauſe to ſhine reſplendently before the enlightned Souls Eye, before Faith can receive ſuch full aſſurance, as to work by way of fulneſs of confidence and aſſurance, and that's this, The Spirit doth evidence from the Goſpel, or from the promiſe, <hi>The Lord Chriſts unqueſtionable willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to embrace every poor loſt ſinner that is willing to embrace him.</hi> Indeed the Lord Chriſt doth prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily embrace loſt ſinners into the boſom of his
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:48673:135"/>
love, and joyns them everlaſtingly to himſelf, yea and compleats the relative union, between him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and their Souls whilſt they are meer pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, altogether under an impoſſibility of any ſuch Spiritual action, or ſo much as any concurrence with the Lord Jeſus, in the compleating of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative union: But this union remains inviſible till by the vertue of this paſſive, or this relative union, the dead Soul is inabled by actual believing, active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to cloſe in union with the Lord Jeſus, and to embrace him to be one with him. And therefore to the leaſt degree of the knowledge of a Souls union with Chriſt, of neceſſity the Spirit muſt preſent the Lord Chriſt with his pretious everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arms of love, to embrace ſuch loveleſs ſinners as will embrace him, that thereby the Soul may be ſatisfied concerning the object that he believeth, and may cloſe with the Lord Chriſt propounded, and make application of that union tendred in the Lord Jeſus with himſelf. Now for the Spirit evidencing this to the Soul ſatisfyingly, and to make the Soul in believing to triumph, the Spirit is wont to evidence divers particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Spirit is wont to evidence the conſent and agreement of the bleſſed Trinity from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in that glorious deſign of the Lord Jeſus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining every loſt deſpicable ſinner that will embrace him.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The Spirit reveals the conſent of God the Father to that glorious deſign, and that in divers particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that God the Father impoſed a command upon the Lord Jeſus to embrace every ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable loſt ſinner, that would give him enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:48673:136"/>
as his Mediator. This you ſhall ſee in <hi>John</hi> 6.37, 38. <hi>whoever cometh unto me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I will in no wiſe caſt him out;</hi> that is, whoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth me through believing, I will in no wiſe reject him or caſt him off, or refuſe to be a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator between God and him: <hi>I will in no wiſe caſt him out,</hi> that is, under no reſpect, no notion or conſideration that can be imagined: Now obſerve what's the reaſon of this, you ſhall ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 38. <hi>For I came down from Heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me; and this is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will, that of all which he hath given me I ſhould loſe nothing;</hi> that is, of all that he ſhould draw to believe on me, I ſhould loſe none, but ſhould raiſe him up at the laſt day; <hi>and this is the will of him that ſent me, that he that ſeeth the Son and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on him, ſhould have everlaſting life.</hi> So <hi>John</hi> 10.15, to 18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit reveals God the Fathers infuſion of a diſpoſition of love into the Heart of Jeſus Chriſt, purpoſely that he might embrace every loſt ſinner, that would entertain him as his Mediator. Saith he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.7, 8. <hi>Lo I come to do thy will, O my God, thy Law is within my Heart,</hi> that is, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to yield obedience to this thy will, and in effect it was a diſpoſition of love; the Law of being a Mediator was nothing but a Law of love, and this Law was written in the Heart by God the Father.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Father prepared a ſutable body for the ſecond perſon in Trinity to become Mediator in, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.4. <hi>A body haſt thou prepared me;</hi> that is, thou haſt prepared me a Body fit to be offered up for ſin; that is, fit to become a ready willing
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:48673:136"/>
ſacrifice for poor loſt ſinners, that I might redeem them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In that God the Father did engage the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus by his own love to him, to love every ſuch loſt undone ſinner as ſhould embrace him. This you ſhall ſee if you compare <hi>John</hi> 10.17, 18, with <hi>John</hi> 15.10. Saith Chriſt, <hi>therefore doth my father love me, becauſe I lay down my life that I may take it again:</hi> And ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>If you keep my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, you ſhall abide in my love, even as I have kept my Fathers Commandments and abide in his love:</hi> Hence Chriſt intimateth, not only that his Father lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, for his undertaking that work of mercy and pitty to poor loſt undone ſinners, but that his Father did lay the engagement of his love upon him; So that as he reſpects his Fathers love, and deſires the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of it to him, ſo he ſhould be pittifull to every loſt ſinner that embraceth him.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The conſent of the Son the Lord Jeſus himſelf, is revealed by the Spirit for the clearing of this. And that the Spirit may and doth reveal in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the free ready conſent of the Lord Jeſus, to the bleſſed will of his Father. The Lord Chriſt made no objection againſt the bleſſed command, though take it in all the latitude of it, it was the hardeſt command that ever was impoſed upon any creature in heaven or earth, a command to ſpend his deareſt innocent blood, a command to become a curſe, a command to deprive himſelf of the raviſhing viſion of his Fathers face, yet this command he never ſtuck at, but ſaith, in the Volumn of the Book it is written, <hi>Lo I come to do thy will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In that he took infinite delight in the yielding obedience to this his Fathers will, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8. <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to do thy will, O my God;</hi> He took pleaſure in
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:48673:137"/>
it, and was ſtraightned in his Spirit till it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The Spirit reveals the conſent of the bleſſed Spirit, proceeding both from God the Father and God the Son in this bleſſed deſign. And that's in this, that the ſpirit freely, and in the very fulneſs of it, took up his habitation in the Lord Chriſt, thus conſtituted to be Mediator, to fill him with grace, and love and pitty, for the accompliſhment of this bleſſed work of gathering in loſt ſinners into union with himſelf. This the Spirit reveals in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the manner or form of the Spirit deſcending down upon Chriſt. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.22. It came down in the ſhape of a Dove, to ſhew it came on purpoſe to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Mediator with mercy and pitty to poor deſpicable loveleſs ſinners, that he might be nothing but a lump of love wrapped up in fleſh.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit reveals the end for which the Spirit was thus poured out upon him in the fulneſs of it. The end is revealed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1, 2, 3. <hi>To preach good tidings to the meek, to bind up the broken hearted</hi> (that is, poor captivated inſlaved ſouls, under the power of their helliſh enemy) <hi>and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound,</hi> that is, deliverance of them that are held faſt in the chains of darkneſs, under the power of the Prince of darkneſs) <hi>to proclaim the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable year of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Spirit reveals the ſutable Office, that is eſtabliſhed upon the Lord Chriſt, purpoſely to engage him to ſhew mercy and pitty to every loſt ſinner that ſhould embrace him. The Spirit mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts that he is ordained by God the father to be an High Prieſt, to ſacrifice for the ſins of the people. Here the Spirit reveals two things.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:48673:137"/>1. That the qualifications that God looks upon in Chriſt, in ordaining him to be the High-Prieſt, were ſutable diſpoſitions to ſhew mercy and pitty to poor undone Sinners. This you ſhall find in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.2. <hi>He can have compaſſion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way.</hi> Therefore <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.25. That's made a ſpecial qualification in Chriſt as High Prieſt, that he was one who had a fellow feeling of thoſe that he was High Prieſt to, that he had a ſweet ſympathy rolling in his bowels to them, under the infirmity of Sin and miſery.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit reveals that the end of that Office of the Prieſt-hood that was eſtabliſhed upon him, was to ſhew mercy to poor deſpicable undone ſinners. You ſhall ſee in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.1. what are the ends of an High Prieſt;</p>
               <p>Firſt, he is ordained to come to the Mercy-ſeat for man, that is, for the good of poor miſerable men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that he might offer gifts and ſacrifice for ſins, that he might pacifie the angry God, that was incenſed againſt ſinners, that he might reconcile periſhing, loſt, undone ſinners to God the father.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, For evidencing that unqueſtionable wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs of the Lord Jeſus, to accept every ſinner that will embrace him: the ſpirit reveals the exact and exquiſite care, the Lord Jeſus hath taken to reveal himſelf, to prevail with poor undone ſinners to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them into union with himſelf. This the ſpirit evidenceth in five things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By revealing the proviſion of Officers that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath made, to allure and beſeech ſouls to accept the Lord Chriſt to be one with them. After Chriſt was gone into heaven, and had left pleading with undone ſinners with his own bleſſed lips, you
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:48673:138"/>
ſee <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. he ſends out others in his own room, ſuch as might be Embaſſadors repreſenting his own perſon, to beſeech and pray undone ſinners to accept of reconciliation with the father through their union with him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By revealing that the Lord Chriſt took care to furniſh ſuch as he ſent forth, to allure undone ſinners into union with him, with a ſutable ſpirit for that work. Therefore before Jeſus Chriſt would go to his father, <hi>John</hi> 20.22. he goes to his Diſciples and giveth them a Commiſſion to allure ſouls into union with himſelf, and when he had given them the Commiſſion, he breathed on them, and ſaid, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ye the holy ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. By revealing the Lords aſſimilating thoſe whom he betruſts, to reveal himſelf to loſt ſinners. Not only in furniſhing them with abilities of the ſpirit; but alſo in conforming them in their very diſpoſitions unto his own likeneſs, he conveyed his own bowels of mercy and pitty and compaſſion into them, that their bowels might yearn towards the gathering loſt ſinners into communion with him, as the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf yearned. This you ſhall ſee, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.8. That <hi>Paul</hi> tells them he longed after them all in the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt; That is, I longed after your perfection in union and communion with Chriſt, in the bowels that Jeſus Chriſt hath infuſed into me, as ſome interpret it: But indeed the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation may rather be of Jeſus Chriſt, in the ſame bowels that Jeſus Chriſt longed after ſouls, in the ſame kind of pitty and compaſſion, that Jeſus Chriſt had working in his boſom towards undone ſinners.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:48673:138"/>4. By revealing the Lord Jeſus chuſing out ſome deſperate ſinners, on purpoſe to be as patterns of love before the eyes of other loſt ſinners, that he would take into union with himſelf. This is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the ſpirit, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15, 16. to be the end of God to ſhew mercy to that blaſphemer, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuter, that injurious one to Jeſus Chriſt, that he might ſhew forth a pattern to other ſinners that ſhould hereafter believe on him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By revealing the Lord Chriſt to have improved all his intereſt, in thoſe that are his own, to engage them to help forward the work, in gathering loſt ſinners into union with him. As in <hi>John</hi> 21.15, 16, 17. when Jeſus Chriſt was to leave the earth, and would engage <hi>Peter</hi> to do ſome great thing for him, he engaged him to reveal himſelf to poor miſerable ſouls; that's under the term or notion here of feeding his Lambs and Sheep.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. For the evidencing the willingneſs of the Lord Chriſt to accept into union every loveleſs ſinner that will embrace him, the ſpirit reveals the abſolute engagement of Chriſt, by his own joy, and by his own glory that is ſupernatural, to embrace every loveleſs ſinner that is willing to entertain him. The Lord Chriſt conſidered as head to a myſtical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, may be ſaid to be imperfect, till all ſinners that ſhall ever belong to him be gathered in; And Jeſus Chriſt even wants his Joy and Glory that he ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy as a Mediator, ſo long as there is but one loſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner belonging to that myſtical body to be gathered in: Therefore it is impoſſible for Jeſus Chriſt to reject one ſinner that ſhall embrace him, unleſs he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:48673:139"/>There is a third beam of divine light, and that is,<note place="margin">Third beam of divine light.</note> The inſatiable longing and thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord Jeſus, to embrace e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſoul into union that would be united to him. The ſpirit is leading the ſoul from one degree of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his faith, to another, till at laſt he cometh to give a full ground of ſatisfaction to the ſoul, to make his union with Chriſt appear, that faith hath ground not only of confidence but of triumph. Now the ſpirit doth evidence this unto the ſoul for his ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction two ways.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The ſpirit reveals the grounds from whence the longings of Jeſus Chriſt after union with the ſoul do proceed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſpirit reveals the expreſſion of thoſe longings of Jeſus Chriſt by himſelf.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The ſpirit reveals the ground whence thoſe longings proceed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſpirit evidenceth the near alliance, and precious relations, that Jeſus Chriſt accounts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have, unto all thoſe loſt Sinners that long after union with him, or that ever ſhall be brought into union with him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Spirit reveals, that the Lord Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts all thoſe loſt Souls his Brethren. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt in <hi>John</hi> 20.17. when he ſends <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to tell the bleſſed news of his reſurrection to his Diſciples, ſaith he, <hi>Go tell my brethren, that I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend unto my father and your father, to my God and your God. [Go tell my brethren.]</hi> That is, thoſe that are joynt adopted ones by my father, as my brethren, the joynt beloved ones, as I am beloved of the father as Mediator. Now from hence the ſpirit manifeſts,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48673:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the ſoul of Chriſt cannot but long after union with all thoſe ſouls, that will embrace him into union.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſpirit reveals that the Lord Chriſt accounts all thoſe that ſhall embrace him to be as his Spouſe, as thoſe that are to be married to him. Jeſus Chriſt hath infinite longings after himſelf and his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and then <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.28. <hi>He that loveth his wife, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth himſelf,</hi> therefore Jeſus Chriſt doth but love himſelf, and his own glory, in deſiring the union of ſouls with himſelf, and therefore his longings cannot be leſs than infinite and incomprehenſible.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſpirit evidenceth, that Jeſus Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts all ſouls that ſhall embrace him, as his own members, without which he is not compleat as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator. The fulneſs of Chriſt myſticall is the Church, and he accounts not himſelf perfect till all his myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body be gathered to him. Now hence the ſpirit manifeſts infinite longings in the boſom of Jeſus Chriſt, after every ſoul that would be one with him, as he longs after his own good.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſpirit reveals that the Lord Chriſt accounts every ſoul that will embrace him to be a part of his own glory. Chriſt accounts not his own glory to be full, till all thoſe loſt ſouls that ever ſhall embrace him, be perfectly and compleatly joyned to him. Now hence the ſpirit manifeſts, that there cannot but be infinite longings in the boſom of Jeſus Chriſt, after the union of ſuch ſouls with himſelf, as would have union with him, or are willing to embrace him, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he cannot but infinitely long after the perfection of his own glory; And ſeeing he cannot long after his own glory in the perection of it, but he muſt long after the union of every loſt ſoul that will embrace him into union with himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:48673:140"/>2. The ſpirit alſo remembers the ſoul of thoſe dreadful ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt, for all thoſe ſouls that ever ſhall embrace him. Now from thence the ſpirit evidenceth three ways, that there cannot but be ſuch longings of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the love of Chriſt to thoſe ſouls is aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. There is no more prevailing argument of love, than ſuffering evil for the beloved one.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſpirit evidenceth from thence, that Jeſus Chriſt hath a nearer intereſt in them. The propriety of Chriſt is as well augmented by his ſufferings as his love. Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19, 20. <hi>Ye are not your own,</hi> why? <hi>for ye are bought with a price.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſpirit reveals that there is a higher degree of Joy in the boſom of Chriſt, in the obtaining of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them. Therefore, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. Chriſt is ſaid, <hi>to ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and to be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> That is, he ſhall ſee ſouls gathered in to him as the fruit of all his ſufferings, and this ſhall ſatisfie him. Now from hence the ſpirit reveals the unſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able longings of Chriſt, after the union of thoſe ſouls that ſhall embrace him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſpirit reveals the ſenſibleneſs of the Lord Chriſt of his own duty, as he is Mediator, to gather ſuch loſt ſouls as will embrace him, into union with him. This you may find <hi>John</hi> 10.15, 16. Saith Chriſt, <hi>I have other ſheep which are not of this fold, them alſo I muſt bring in:</hi> As if Chriſt ſhould have ſaid, there is neceſſity, I am engaged by duty to my father, in reſpect of the command my father laid upon me, to gather thoſe loſt ſouls into union with me.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:48673:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>4. The ſpirit reveals, that it is onely ſutable to the nature of Jeſus Chriſt, to be gathering loſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done Sinners into union with him. His nature is nothing but an abſtract or quinteſſence of love, as Mediator, and therefore it is only natural to him to be pouring out of his love into empty ſouls.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſpirit evidenceth the expreſſions of thoſe longings of Jeſus Chriſt by himſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The ſpirit preſents Jeſus Chriſt ſeeking after ſuch loſt ſinners, to gather them into union with him, when their backs are altogether turned upon him, and when they have altogether forgotten him. This ſpirit cauſeth the ſoul to hear from the mouth of God himſelf, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.10. <hi>The Son of man is come to ſeek and ſave that which is loſt. It is my office,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>for which I came down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſpirit manifeſts the Lord Chriſts ſtrong compaſſionate cries of love after ſuch ſouls, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a bleſſed union and communion with himſelf. This the ſpirit cauſeth the ſoul to hear, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Let him that is athirſt come, and whoſoever will let him come, and take of the water of life freely.</hi> So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1, 2. <hi>Ho every one that is in any want, in any neceſſity, any poor thirſty ſoul, come ye,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>buy wine and milk without money and without price.</hi> Here the ſpirit cauſeth the ſoul,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To diſcerern the loud cry of Jeſus Chriſt after ſuch poor, dead, ſluggiſh ſouls to embrace them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſpirit cauſeth the ſoul to ſee the redoubling of his cry and call. <hi>Come ye,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, yea again, <hi>come,</hi> and again, <hi>come,</hi> as if his bowels yearned.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:48673:141"/>3. The ſpirit lots the ſoul ſee, his propounding all the precious arguments, that can poſſibly be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to prevail with ſouls. Come, ſaith Chriſt, buy Wine and Milk, take the moſt precious ſoul-raviſhing comforts, the ſweeteſt Cordials to thy poor needy fainting ſoul.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The ſpirit reveals the low condeſcention of Jeſus Chriſt to become an intreater, a beſeecher of ſouls to accept of that union propounded. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. <hi>We are Embaſſadours for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead be reconciled to God,</hi> that is, be ye one with God.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The ſpirit reveals that the Lord Chriſt hath put his own Spirit in commiſſion for that end, to make all theſe longings of his evident to the ſoul, and theſe expreſſions of his longings in his Cries and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, effectual upon ſouls. The ſpirit reveals to the ſoul, the ſtrength of the deſires of Jeſus Chriſt, to be ſo ſuperlative, as to take care leaſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the expreſſions of his longings, the ſoul ſhould ſtill remain unconquered, and therefore he adds as it were a ſupplement to all his former deſires of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him, he adds his own ſpirit to ſtand as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Officer for that end, to convince the ſoul of his longings that they ſhould have union with him. Therefore he ſends the comforter, <hi>John</hi> 16.7.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The ſpirit reveals the Lords Tender, Pittiful, Compaſſionate diſcovery of the dreadful danger of neglect of union with him. According to that in <hi>John</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>God ſent not his Son into the World to condemn, but that the World through him might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:</hi> I tell you ſouls, ſaith Chriſt, the very intention
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:48673:141"/>
of my Father in ſending me, is not to augment your Sins, that your condemnation ſhould be augmented, but it is his intention that you might be ſaved: And then <hi>v.</hi> 18. he reveals to them the deſperate ſtate of them that <hi>neglect this Salvation</hi> that he brings, <hi>He that believeth not, is condemned already.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. The ſpirit reveals that the Lord waits to be gracious, and even waits as it were the leiſure of poor loſt undone ſouls, to accept of that bleſſed union tendered. The ſpirit preſents the Lord Jeſus ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the door of hearts and knocking, till his head is wet with the dew, and his locks with the drops of the night, waiting for the ſouls accepting of that bleſſed union with himſelf that he tenders.</p>
               <p>There is a fourth beam of divine light the ſpirit cauſeth further to ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle forth from the Goſpel in this work of Irradiation, or manifeſtation of it,<note place="margin">Fourth beam of divine light.</note> and that is this. <hi>The abſolute independency of this willingneſs of Jeſus Chriſt to accept ſouls into union, upon any thing in the Souls whom he is thus wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to accept, and after union with him his ſoul thus longs.</hi> There can be no act of Faith by way of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of confidence or aſſurance, till there be ſuch a clear apprehenſion of the acceptance of the particular ſoul into union with the Lord Jeſus, that all matter of fear vaniſheth, and all occaſion of doubt is taken away, by the clearneſs of that light that the ſpirit caſts into the underſtanding, and by the clear ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction it gives the ſoul concerning his acceptance by Jeſus Chriſt, to be one with him. Therefore the ſpirit in reſpect to thoſe Multitudes of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:48673:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fears, that commonly ariſe in ſouls, concerning the unſutableneſs of themſelves to be taken into union with Chriſt, for the taking away thoſe occaſions of fear, doth reveal to the ſoul that the willingneſs of the Lord Jeſus to accept it into union, and the longings of Jeſus Chriſt after union with ſouls, hath not the leaſt dependance upon any thing in the ſoul it ſelf, whence he accepts it into union. Now for the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing of this, the ſpirit may and doth evidence theſe three things to the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The ſpirit evidenceth the impoſſibility of the will of the glorious Deity, to be moved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> any thing without it ſelf, in any of the motions of his love whatever. So that thence the ſpirit evidenceth to the ſoul, that it were a denying of the glory of the God-head, to conceive that God ſhould look out of himſelf for any argument, any motive, any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centive, that ſhould either excite or incline the divine will to any motions of love whatever to wards any creature.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſpirit evidenceth the abſolute will of the Father alone, to be the firſt principle, and alſo the only cauſe of admiſſion of ſouls into union and communion with the Lord Jeſus. So that both the purpoſe of God to accept ſouls into union, and alſo the execution of that his purpoſe, do depend only upon the Lords bare will, and good pleaſure. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5, 6, compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The ſpirit evidenceth the Lord Chriſts wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to accept of ſouls into union, to be only done through the Commiſſion that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, from the good pleaſure of his Fathers
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:48673:142"/>
will concerning ſuch ſouls. According to that in <hi>John</hi> 6.37, 38. When he ſaith he would reject no one ſoul in no wiſe, under no conſideration whatever; he gives this reaſon, for <hi>I came down from Heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a fifth beam of light that the ſpirit cauſeth to ſhine forth from the Goſpel, and that is,<note place="margin">Fifth beam of divine light.</note> The admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and incomprehenſible fulneſs of all perfection of love and mercy, that is comprehended in this tender of union with the Lord Chriſt, to every particular Soul that will accept it. Notwithſtanding thoſe former beams of divine light, there is a two fold neceſſity for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to cauſe this beam of divine light alſo to ſparkle before the ſouls eyes.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That there may be a fulneſs of ſufficiency to produce acts of Faith in a ſoul, by way of fulneſs of confidence and aſſurance. And in this regard, there is a neceſſity of the ſpirits caſting this beam of light alſo before the ſouls eyes, to open the incomprehenſible perfection of all kind of love, that the ſoul ſoul can imagine he ſhould have the leaſt neceſſity of.</p>
               <p n="2">II. To excite and quicken the affections to more enlarged operations or workings. Though there hath been a former apprehenſion of the infinite perfection of love, in the tender of the union, yet there is no anſwerable working of affection towards the union, unleſs there be that very actual Viſion: Now when the operation of the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:48673:143"/>
affections towards the union tendered are but ſmall, then the ſouls aſſurance of its acting of Faith, by way of fulneſs of confidence of its uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt, is but in a ſmall degree. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is in this reſpect, that the ſpirit doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the abſolute, compleat, incomprehenſible perfection of love that is included in the tender of union. And this the ſpirit doth in divers parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſpirit reveals the Lords tender of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing over himſelf, and all that is in himſelf, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto ſouls through this union with Chriſt. For the evidencing this, the ſpirit only brings to remembrance, the ſum of all the promiſes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Lords own abſtract and Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium that he hath made of them; And that is this, That God hath ſaid he will be the ſouls God in Chriſt. Here are two particulars included under this one depth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The ſpirit manifeſts that the higheſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that is poſſible to make a ſoul capable of, in the infinite perfection of God himſelf, is offered to be paſſed over to the ſoul in the tender of union.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſpirit manifeſts that the Lord of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers in this tender of union to intereſt the ſoul in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with ſuch an intereſt as ſhould be moſt ſutable, for the fulleſt communication of himſelf to the ſoul, that it ſhall be as proper and peculiar for God to love the ſoul, as it ſhould be proper to the nature of God to be loving himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſpirit reveals that the Lord hath laid the higheſt obligation upon himſelf, to be the ſouls own in all that he is, in his paſſing over himſelf unto the ſoul through that union with Chriſt. This the ſpirit
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:48673:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>
manifeſts by bringing to remembrance the Lords aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverations, and proteſtations, and higheſt oath that he adds unto that his word, that declares him to paſs over himſelf unto ſouls through their union with Chriſt. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſpirit reveals the Lords eſtabliſhing the tranſactions of himſelf, and all that is in himſelf over to the ſoul, through its union with Chriſt, upon his own will alone, on purpoſe that there might be a fulneſs of all love contained in him. Three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ends the ſpirit may bring to the Souls remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance for the clearing of this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That there might be no poſſibility of an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that perfect love of his to a ſoul through union with Chriſt, by any Power or Poſſibility of the ſoul. The Holy Ghoſt affirms <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.9. The Lords Election of love to be meerly eſtabliſhed upon his own will, for that end that the Election might ſtand being <hi>not of Works but of Grace;</hi> That is, that it might be certain, being unchangable; So as the ſouls wickedneſs and wretchedneſs, riſing to what height ſoever, yet it might not be able to make an alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that perfect love. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That there might be a fulneſs of love, and to make a conſtant immutable ground for his peoples faith to reſt upon him for the perfection of of his love towards them. This the ſpirit may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal to the ſoul from that in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.17, 18. The Lord is ſaid to add the confirmation of his Oath, that there might be two immutable grounds, in which it was <hi>impoſſible for God to Lie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, That his people might have a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſatisfactory conſolation, from that fulneſs of his love, in all neceſſities, upon all occaſions,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:48673:144"/>
and at all times. That by two immutable things they might have ſtrong conſolation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſpirit reveals the Lords undertaking, to effect in, and for the ſoul, the whole tranſaction of himſelf over unto the ſoul, through his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt by the Almighty Power of his own love alone. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5. The whole work of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is attributed to nothing but love. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit reveals this two ways.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The ſpirit reveals that the Lord hath engaged himſelf by promiſe, to effect the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of himſelf over unto the ſoul, by the Almighty Power of his love. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 41.10, 11.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſpirit remembers the ſoul, of the neceſſity that the Lord hath impoſed upon Jeſus Chriſt to effect it. <hi>John</hi> 10.16.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſpirit reveals, that the Lord hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken the ſutable tempering and diſpoſing of the ſoul, for all ſutable walking in union with the Lord Jeſus that is tendered. This the ſpirit may and doth evidence from that in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. Where the Lord reveals it to be the very Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: <hi>This ſhall be my Covenant,</hi> or this ſhall be the love that I will promiſe; This is part of Gods love to ſouls united to him, to Write his Law in their Hearts, that is, to conform their ſpirits to all his Bleſſed Will, to make their Hearts anſwerable and ſutable to the union with Chriſt, and all the ways of God that they ought to walk in by vertue of that union.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:48673:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>6. The Spirit manifeſts the Lords undertaking the preſervation of the Soul by his own power, to the full everlaſting injoyment of all the fruits of union. This the Spirit may and doth reveal, it may be from that in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27. when the Lord declares it to be his own reſolution, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thoſe he accepts to be partakers of thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Love through union with Chriſt, that his own Spirit ſhall dwell within them, <hi>and he will cauſe them to walk in his Statutes and do them, and keep them that they ſhall not depart from him:</hi> That it ſhall not be in the power of the Soul to bereave it ſelf of all thoſe pretious fruits of that bleſſed union with the Lord Jeſus, but the Soul muſt of neceſſity (unleſs the Almighty power of God ſhould fail) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the fulneſs of all love and communion, as the conſequence of the union with Chriſt. And for the further evidence of this, the Spirit may and doth reveal it by two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Spirit remembers the Soul, that the Lord hath made it his own choſen delight, to be carrying on the Soul towards the injoyment of that fulneſs and perfection of love, and through his union even the perfection of communion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Spirit reveals the Lord to hang the higheſt manifeſtation of his glory, upon the filllng thoſe with all fulneſs of love and mercy, that are received into that union with the Lord Jeſus. And hereby the Spirit ſatisfies the Soul and convinceth it, that the Lord himſelf is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in perfecting the fruits and conſequences of the Souls union with Chriſt; that unleſs the Lord ſhould deny himſelf, there is an impoſſibility of the Lords failing to preſerve the Soul by
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:48673:145"/>
his own power, unto the perfect and full injoyment of the perfection of communion, as the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Sixth beam of Light the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit manifeſts from the Goſpel is this,<note place="margin">Sixth beam of Divine Light.</note> 
                  <hi>The Spirit manifeſts the compleat ſufficiency, yea the abundancy and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundancy of ſecurity that is given, to ſecure Souls of their injoyment of all the Goſpel thus diſcovers to them.</hi> Now for the making this beam of light ſhine forth in its Beauty and Glory, the Spirit may and doth evidence many things.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Firſt, The Spirit evidenceth the Lords enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Covenant with Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator, and engaging himſelf in that Covenant, to effect the mercy and love that the Goſpel diſcovers, for every Soul that ſhall embrace him. Two things are to be opened here.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Lord did thus enter into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What ſecurity the believing Soul hath from thence, of the Lords effecting of what is ſo diſcovered in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Lord did thus Covenant with Chriſt himſelf is apparent.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard all the whole bundle of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that make up the whole Covenant of the Goſpel, they run primarily to Chriſt, and in his name. To ſhew that God and Chriſt were the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters together, that the Covenant was ſtruck up between the Father and the Son, from before the foundations of the World were laid. If you obſerve the firſt promiſe that ever God the Father gave, or the firſt diſcovery of Goſpel that ever
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:48673:145"/>
was unto Souls, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>The ſeed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhall break the Serpents head:</hi> There is the whole Goſpel, the whole Covenant; but obſerve in whoſe name it runs, in the name of Chriſt, <hi>The ſeed of the Woman,</hi> that is Chriſt; that is, Chriſt myſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, including his Members too, but it is Chriſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily; <hi>He ſhall break the Serpents head,</hi> that is, ſhall triumph over Satan, ſhall get the victory over Hell, and ſpoil him that hath formerly taken Souls captive.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It appears in regard Chriſt himſelf takes God the Father as his God, <hi>John</hi> 20.17. <hi>I aſcend to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.</hi> So that hence it appears, that God the Father hath engaged himſelf in a ſolemn Covenant, unto Jeſus Chriſt as Mediator, <hi>from before the foundations of the World were laid,</hi> to effect what ever the Goſpel diſcovers, for every Soul that ſhould embrace him. And it is from thence that Chriſt prays, in <hi>John</hi> 17.24. <hi>Father I will that thoſe that thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, We may ſee what aſſurance this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords unto Souls of their unqueſtionable infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble injoyment of all that the Goſpel thus diſcovers. There is a two fold ſecurity from hence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard God the Father ſtands engaged in a ſolemn Covenant, to effect all that the Goſpel thus diſcovers unto thoſe Souls that have, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, received Chriſt to be their Husband and Head.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The believing Soul is to know and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, the Lord Chriſt to have repreſented every Soul that ſhall embrace him, in entering into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:48673:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with the Father. Though the Covenant runs to Chriſt, it was but as Chriſt was the firſt Elect of God, repreſenting all the other Elect; it was but as Chriſt was a common perſon, a ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> that had all that ſhould believe in him, in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had all that were to come out of his loins included in him, and bound up in him in the firſt Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Secondly, The Spirit reveals the Father to have paid the higheſt and deareſt price, for the effecting it, and for every Souls embracing Chriſt, what the Goſpel diſcovers in the ſureſt way unto Souls apprehenſions. This the Spirit reveals in diſcovering God the Father, to have given the dearly beloved of his Soul for that end, to bring about Goſpel mercies to be conveyed to Souls, in the ſureſt way to Souls own conceptions and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions. According to that, in <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son, &amp;c.</hi> For the clearing of this, there muſt be two things opened.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Father was at the higheſt coſt and charge, and did pay the greateſt price, to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thoſe mercies for Souls.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That one intent of the Father in paying ſo high a price for Souls, was to ſatisfie Souls of the injoyment of them in their own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Father paid ſo high a price, for the effecting that mercy and love, that the Goſpel diſcovers for Souls that will embrace him; will appear in three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that it coſt the Father the abaſement for a ſeaſon, of his own eſſential glory. I do not mean,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:48673:146"/>
as if there could have been an extenuation of the eſſential glory of God; but I mean there was a vailing of that eſſential glory, ſo as thoſe reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent beams of his glory ſhined not forth. This the Father did in that his dearly beloved, his only begotten Son, (that had but one and the ſame eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and ſo the ſame eſſential glory with himſelf) ſhould take upon him that frail, vile, deſpicable nature of Man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard the Father deprived himſelf for a ſeaſon of his higheſt delight, his moſt infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, for the effecting thoſe Goſpel mercies. The Fathers delight is in Communion, and the higher degree of Communion, the higher is the delight of God. Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.31. <hi>That he delights in the habitable parts of the Earth, and with the Sons of Men;</hi> that is, becauſe there are Creatures capable of Communion with God, there are empty Veſſels that he may be pouring out of his tranſcendent fulneſs into. Now God deprived himſelf of his own higheſt delight, in withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the communications of himſelf from that his dearly beloved Son, that he was forced to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It coſt the Father the very death, yea the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed death, of the moſt dearly beloved of his Soul, the Lord Jeſus. <hi>He delivered him up to death, for us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Yea it coſt the Father the ſuffering the execution of his full wrath and indignation, upon the dearly beloved of his Soul.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It muſt be opened, that the Father was at the higheſt coſt and charge, in effecting that
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:48673:147"/>
mercy for Souls, that ſhall embrace the Lord Chriſt tendered, on purpoſe to make it the ſurer to Souls apprehenſions, to give them the fuller ſecurity of all that the Goſpel diſcovers. This will appear in three things.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In regard there was no abſolute neceſſity in reſpect of God himſelf, to effect that which the Goſpel diſcovers, for Souls embracing Chriſt in that way, at ſuch high coſt and charge to himſelf. That will appear in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard there was a fulneſs of power in the Lords mercy, to give abſolute pardon unto ſinners, irreſpectively to ſatisfaction. The Lord being the high Soveraign of Heaven and Earth, whoſe ſole incommunicable property is, that his will is the original of all Law, the original of the being of all goodneſs, he hath an abſolute power in his own mercy, to have given an abſolute pardon to every tranſgreſſion, committed againſt his own Law: The Lords Will being the only rule that he walks by; and that Will of his being altogether independent, hath a power within it ſelf, to have given an abſolute pardon to every tranſgreſſion againſt his Will.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard the Lord in the effecting of the love and mercy, that the Goſpel diſcovers to Souls, did not proceed according to the exacteſt rule of Juſtice. Do not miſtake me, I mean not according to the height and rigor of Juſtice as Juſtice, which of neceſſity muſt have been, had the Lord been bound to his Juſtice to proceed that way. That appears in two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The higheſt exact rule of Juſtice, admits of no ſurety in capital Crimes. It requires the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:48673:147"/>
perſon to be the ſufferer of the evil threatned for the breach of the Law that was the tranſgreſſor of the Law. The voice of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Juſtice was only in this wiſe, <hi>The Soul that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſhall die,</hi> without any admiſſion of any Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Now it is apparent that the Lord himſelf in the bringing about, or effecting the Love and Mercy that the Goſpel diſcovers unto Souls, he propounds this way to admit of a Surety. Thoſe that were the offenders of Juſtice were not ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers under Juſtice; but another ſteps in, and bears the ſtroke of Juſtice, that in regard of his own perſonal tranſgreſſion, was not guilty of the breach of the Law, or of the Offence againſt Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Were it poſſible for exact Juſtice to admit a Surety, yet not poſſible for exact Juſtice to find out a Surety, working ſtill as Juſtice: Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice never looks further than the Tranſgreſſor himſelf to exact Juſtice upon, unleſs it be to lay the merit and deſert of the tranſgreſſor, in ſome degree, upon all that have dependance upon him. Never came a thought into Juſtice, as Juſtice, of remitting the leaſt degree of puniſhment of the Tranſgreſſor; yet you ſee in the way that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, he caſts about in his own thoughts, to find out one ſufficient to bear all the burden of wrath and indignation that is due to Tranſgreſſors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The Lord in his deſign of glorifying his Juſtice, in effecting Love and Mercy for Souls diſcovered in the Goſpel, he proceeds only accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Love it ſelf; yea, according to nothing elſe but Love in reſpect of Souls; it being an act of ſimple, abſolute, pure Love, to impute the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the poor guilty Spirit to the ſpotleſs
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:48673:148"/>
Lamb, the Lord Jeſus; as if he had been to have pardoned thoſe Tranſgreſſors, and to have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them clearly from Sin, without the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of thoſe Tranſgreſſions to another: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerve the whole Work of Salvation, though contrived by the infinite Wiſdom of God, that Mercy and Juſtice might meet together, and kiſs each other, it is attributed to Love alone, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5. <hi>By Grace</hi> (or Love) <hi>ye are ſaved.</hi> So, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4, 5. <hi>Not by Works of Righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his Mercy he ſaved us.</hi> Still the whole Work is attributed to the Fathers Love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was no abſolute neceſſity of Gods being at that coſt and charge, to procure Love and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for Souls that would embrace him, in reſpect of the Souls themſelves that were to be partakers of it. That will appear in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard Souls partaking of that Love and Mercy that the Goſpel diſcovers, were not the Objects of that Love and Mercy primarily, by that coſt and charge that the Lord was at in the Death of Chriſt, to effect that Love and Mercy. If you obſerve the whole Current of the Scripture, it runs thus; <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave</hi> Chriſt: <hi>To us a Child is born, to us a Son is given:</hi> So that Chriſt being a Gift of Love unto the Soul, it could not be, that they ſhould be made objects of Love primarily by that Gift, that is, original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the firſt place: Chriſt was therefore given, becauſe they were firſt beloved, &amp; not they beloved becauſe Chriſt given; ſeeing the Love of God was fixed upon all its peculiar objects that ever it ſhould be fixed upon in that Gift, and then Chriſt himſelf came forth as a Gift of that fixed Love, it could
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:48673:148"/>
not be that they ſhould be primarily made objects of Love, by the Lords effecting that Love and Mercy for them, through his great Coſt, of giving the dearly beloved of his Soul for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe Souls that ſhall embrace Chriſt tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Goſpel, were the Objects of that Goſpel-Love and Mercy diſcovered in order of nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords intention to effect that Goſpel-Love and Mercy for them, by that his own coſt in giving his own Son. The Lord Chriſt is diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the Means by which God brings about the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of his Love unto his beloved ones: and the End is diſcovered in the Goſpel, to be the <hi>Glory of his own Love,</hi> to make his Love glorious in thoſe objects: Therefore the End muſt in order of Nature, according to our conception, be before the Means (though all things are at once, and by one Act done by God) ſo that according to our conceptions, the Love muſt be firſt fixed and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon Souls in order of nature; I mean, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Love muſt be firſt unto Souls, before the conveyance of that Gift of Love through Chriſt. Thence 'tis that the Scripture ſpeaks of Chriſt, not only as given, but alſo called out to the work of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.1. He was ordained to be <hi>the High Prieſt</hi> by God the Father, <hi>to offer Sacrifice for Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There can be no End of the Lords being at that high charge for the effecting of the Love and Mercy that the Goſpel diſcovers to Souls that will embrace him, but his own praiſe, and his peoples comfort. Seeing there was no neceſſity (I ſpeak of abſolute and indiſpenſable neceſſity all this while; I would not be miſtaken in a thing of ſo high a nature) I ſay, ſeeing there was no abſolute
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:48673:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſimple neceſſity for the Lord to be at ſuch high coſt, in reſpect of himſelf, and in reſpect of Souls, to partake of this Mercy; but it is done freely of God according to his own wiſdom. Thence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, there can be no higher End than the Lords own praiſe, the manifeſting the Beams of the Lords tranſcendent Glory more abundantly in the Eyes of Saints and Angels: And this you ſhall find to be the very End of it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4.6. Saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>He hath choſen us in Chriſt:</hi> That is, He hath choſen us as the Members of Chriſt, the firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of God, and that Head of the Myſtical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that God hath glorified himſelf in: This he hath done, ſaith he, <hi>before the foundation of the world;</hi> and therefore he deſtinated us <hi>to the adoption of Children by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Here is the Fathers Love in the Means, and in the End. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>To the praiſe of the Glory of his Grace,</hi> that is of his own Love; <hi>wherein,</hi> that is, in which Love, <hi>he hath made us acccepted in the Beloved,</hi> that is in Chriſt. Now this may be taken rwo wayes: Either for his praiſe actively to be given to him, by the Soul that partakes of that Love and Mercy that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel diſcovers: Or elſe paſſively, to be manifeſted through this way, unto thoſe that partake of that Love and Mercy that the Goſpel diſcovers: In both ways the Lord intended to have his glorious Love admired and adored, and himſelf ſanctified in the beholding of it; through the effecting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying of that his Love and Mercy unto Souls, through ſuch coſt and charge, in giving his dearly beloved Son. Now obſerve it; There are eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally two wayes, how the partaker of that Love and Mercy the Goſpel diſcovers, doth actively
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:48673:149"/>
give the Lord the praiſe of the glory of his Love.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In admiring the unmeaſurable dimenſions of his Love, in gazing upon the height, and depth, and length, and breadth of his Love, ſo as to ſee it unmeaſurable and bottomleſs, and to adore God in beholding it. 2. In their Souls relying with a fulneſs of confidence upon God, for that his Love in Chriſt. It is alwayes in the ſame degree, wherein a Soul takes up its reſt in God for any thing, that a Soul ſanctifies God in his heart; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iſ.</hi> 8.13. when the Prophet exhorts them to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie God, he ſaith, <hi>Fear not their fear, but make him your fear and your dread;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you ſhall ſanctifie him, when your ſpirits take up their reſt in him alone. Now as God is thus ſanctified in the heart in general, ſo he is ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the heart in reſpect of every particular At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of his, in this way only, when a Souls confidence is in him alone: And thus in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in reſpect of his Love: God hath the praiſe of the glory of his Love from the Soul, when the Heart takes up its full reſt in God, with a fulneſs of confidence for all Love through Chriſt. Now obſerve, theſe being the two ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial wayes how the Lord hath the praiſe of his glorious Love from Souls that partake of the Love that the Goſpel diſcovers, and then both theſe proceeding from a Souls apprehenſion of the certainty and infallibility of the Lords Love in Chriſt; thence it muſt needs appear, that the Lords being at the high coſt to effect all that Love and Mercy diſcovered in the Goſpel for Souls, through the death of that dearly beloved of his Soul, that this muſt be on purpoſe done
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:48673:150"/>
by God, for the making that his Love and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that the Goſpel diſcovers, more ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto Souls embracing it in their own appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Spirit diſcovers the Lords own Bond, given out to the perſons themſelves that ſhall embrace the Goſpel, for their aſſurance of all that the Goſpel diſcovers. All the Promiſes writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Lords Bleſſed Book are but as ſo many Bonds of Gods own writing, by the hand of the great Secretary of Heaven, the bleſſed Spirit of God, on purpoſe to confirm and aſſure Souls of all that the Goſpel diſcovers. The Spirit reveals Promiſe upon Promiſe, to ſeal to and confirm the ſame thing; as you may ſee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12, 13, 14, 15. The Promiſe is ſaid to be given there as a Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Immutability of the Lords Counſel, that is, of the infallible and unchangeable cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of all that the Goſpel diſcovers.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Spirit riſeth higher; he adds the confirmation of his own Oath, the higheſt Oath that was poſſible for God to ſwear; which was by himſelf, that the Soul might have ſecurity upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to his weak apprehenſion.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Spirit reveals the adding of the Blood of Chriſt as the Seal to the Bond. The Spirit manifeſts the Lord to have employed Jeſus Chriſt to be the Teſtator to Souls, that by the Death of the Teſtator, the Teſtament, or the Will of God revealed in the Goſpel, might be made unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably certain, that the Soul might have fulneſs of ſecurity to his poor ſcrupulous Spirit; now ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity comes in upon ſecurity, to a ſuperabuddance of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:48673:150"/>Sixthly, The Spirit reveals the Lord to have engaged the Honour and Credit of his ever-bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Name, for the better ſecuring Souls, and fuller aſſuring them of all that the Goſpel diſcovers to them. This you ſhall ſee in <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19. <hi>I will proclaim the Name of the Lord before thee</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Moſes) and will be gracious to whom I will be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and will ſhew mercy to whom I will ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> which doth both include a diſpoſition to be gracious, and a free diſpoſition to be gracious; and it includeth that Grace of his to be ordered only according to his own will. Now did not the Lord freely love loveleſs ſinners upon no other ground but his own will (which is the very Sum of all that the Goſpel ſaith) then this Title of Gods Honour ſhould be defaced and blemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But God ſaith, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.15. <hi>This is my Name for ever, and this is my Memorial to all generations:</hi> That is to ſay, this is the diſtinction whereby I will be known to all generations, that I am the God that ſend out a Redeemer to loſt ſinners; which implicitly and virtually includeth thus much, as if God ſhould ſay, Mine own honour, the higheſt Title of my glory ſhould fail, if I fail of embracing every loveleſs ſinner through the Lord Jeſus, that will accept me. And thence you ſhall obſerve, when the Lord made the cleareſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of himſelf to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 34.6, 7. The very Name whereby he calls himſelf, is that which includeth all that the Goſpel of Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals to ſinners: <hi>The Lord paſſed by him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, The Lord merciful, and gracious, long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, ſlow to anger, and abundant in goodneſs and truth, keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving iniquity,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:48673:151"/>
tranſgreſſion and ſin.</hi> Here is the whole Myſtery of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, and nothing elſe but the Myſtery of the Goſpel, that the Lord owns to be the Name of his Honour, that the Lord would have to be his Title, whereby he would be diſtinguiſhed from others, and whereby he would be known unto Souls.</p>
               <p>Two things muſt be opened for the clearing of it ſufficiently to the ſatisfaction of Souls.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It muſt be opened that the whole myſtery of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt is vertually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the name of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That particular Souls may have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity unto themſelves from that name of God, and may ſafely through believing look upon the honour of his name, as engaged to them, to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil what the Goſpel reveals.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It muſt be opened that the whole myſtery of the Goſpel, or whatever the Goſpel reveals, is included in the name of God: We ſhall open it from that of <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7. which God owns as his name. There are eight titles, that the Lord aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes to himſelf, that make up in the Lords ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count his name, wherein he will be known unto Souls.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The firſt Title of his honour, that concurs to the making up of his name, is <hi>Merciful,</hi> the Lord [Merciful] which includes two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there are bowels of pitty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion in the boſom of God, that there are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious diſpoſitions unto infinite compaſſions, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally dwelling in God. The word is the ſame with that in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.21. which may be rendred [Bowels.]</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:48673:151"/>2. It includes that the Lord is ready to act thoſe bowels of compaſſion, towards Souls drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the depths of the moſt extream miſery. Miſery and Mercy are Relatives, and according to the depths of Miſery, ſo is the height of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Mercy. Now under that very one title, is comprehended the ſum and ſubſtance of all that the Goſpel diſcovers. There is but one voice that the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks in, and that is this, that the Lord is full of bowels of pitty and compaſſion, towards every loveleſs ſinner that will accept his compaſſions tendered.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond Title of God is <hi>Gracious.</hi> This implies two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lords acceptance of loveleſs ſinners in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to favour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The acceptance of miſerable ones into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour meerly out of the freedom of the workings of his own favour, from motives out of his own boſom, without reſpect to any deſert. Therefore the whole voice of the Goſpel is, <hi>by Grace ye are ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. The third Title that concurs to make up the honourable name of God, is, <hi>The Lord long Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> or as it may be rendred [he is Slow to anger.] Here are two things included.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It implies a long time of forbearance in God to execute Judgment upon ſinners, according to their own demerit, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It implies that that forbearance to execute Judgment upon ſinners, according to their ſins, is on purpoſe that ſinners might be accepted into love and favour, and prevent the execution of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:48673:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>IV. The fourth Title of the Lords honour is, <hi>The Lord abundant in Goodneſs,</hi> or excelling in Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. That implies three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The compleat fulneſs of all Goodneſs that can be neceſſary for a Soul, to be treaſured up by God, in the boſom of Chriſt for Souls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It implies a tranſcendency of all ſupply for empty Souls, to be in himſelf through Chriſt. It implies a Superlative Fulneſs, a Fulneſs that is more then ſufficient, a Fulneſs that infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds what ever a Soul can want.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It implies the readineſs and facility of God, to be diſpenſing that goodneſs unto Souls.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The fifth Title of the Lords name is, <hi>That he is abundant in Truth.</hi> Truth doth not here imply Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, but it implies Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in God, to be true according to the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himſelf. So that Truth implies the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the infallibility of the Lords fulfilling unto Souls whatever he promiſed to be treaſured up in himſelf for them.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. There is a ſixth Title that concurs to make up the Lords Honour, that is, his reſerving or his <hi>Keeping Mercy for thouſands.</hi> This implies two things.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) A large comprehenſiveneſs of love and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to be comprehending multitudes of miſerable undone ſinners; <hi>Keeping Mercy for Thouſands:</hi> It is a Synechdochical Speech, a finite Number is put for an infinite.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. There is a ſeventh Title that concurs to make up the Lords Honour, and that is, <hi>Forgiving Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion and Sin.</hi> Here are three ſeveral Expreſſions, that in a large ſenſe point at
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:48673:152"/>
the ſame thing; every iniquity being a tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and every tranſgreſſion being a ſin: yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſomething is intended by the Bleſſed God in proclaiming his Name thus. Some have conceived by Iniquity to be meant Sins againſt God himſelf; by Tranſgreſſion, to be meant Sins againſt our Neighbour; and by Sin, to be meant Sins againſt our own Souls. Others have made them to be ſins of Malice, and ſins of Infirmity, and ſins of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Others conceive by Iniquity (becauſe the word comes from a Root in the Original that ſignifies <hi>Crookedneſs</hi>) to be meant the Corruption of Nature; and by Tranſgreſſion to be meant the Breach of the Law through infirmity; and by Sin, to be meant Stubbornneſs againſt God. However, thus much we may affirm to be the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt, that under theſe three are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended all Sins whatever, of what nature and degree ſoever. Then this Title of the Lords Honour implies thus much, an impoſſibility for any degree of Sin whatever to hinder the Lord from ſhewing mercy, and being gracious in that way of fulneſs of Love, that he reveals himſelf to be inclined to, and to be his own Nature.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. The eighth Title of the Lords Honour includes a Goſpel-Diſcovery too; and that is in thoſe words, <hi>That will by no means clear the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, viſiting the Iniquity of the Fathers upon the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and upon the Childrens Children, unto the third and to the fourth Generation.</hi> This ſeems indeed at firſt view, to have little of Goſpel in it. But I dare not conſent here to the Paraphraſe the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators have given upon the words: But the words are to be rendred thus, <hi>forgiving Iniquity, Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:48673:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Sin,</hi> and in purifying he will not purifie, or in abſolving will not abſolve; not mentioning either wicked ones, or guilty ones, or any perſon whatever. For indeed it ſeems to be a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, ſhould the words run thus, <hi>The Lord forgiving Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion and Sin, and will by no means clear the guilty;</hi> therefore I ſhall hold to the words as they may be moſt nearly rendred; that is, <hi>forgiving ſin,</hi> and cleanſing from ſin he will not cleanſe, <hi>viſiting the Iniquitie of the Fathers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Children.</hi> And then if you obſerve, this title of the Lords Honour is only thus much; That he is the <hi>Lord forgiving Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion and Sin,</hi> and upon whom he will, <hi>viſiting the Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Fathers upon the Children;</hi> including thus much, that the Lord doth and will exerciſe his Mercy, his Grace, his long-ſuffering, and his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant goodneſs unto Souls, only upon the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his own will; upon no other ground but becauſe he will, and to no other perſons upon no other reſpect, but only to thoſe whom himſelf freely will: And then that includes the laſt Beam of the Goſpel-light, after all the other formerly diſcovered (which indeed is the very Myſtery of the Goſpel it ſelf) and that is, that all thoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-diſpenſations are only to thoſe perſons whom the Lord will, and upon no other ground but the Lords Will, though they be ſo tendered to every loveleſs Soul in general that will embrace him. So that thus now you ſee the firſt thing cleared; That all Goſpel-diſcoveries are at leaſt virtually inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Lords own Name.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It muſt be cleared, That the Soul may behold by believing, the Credit and Honour
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:48673:153"/>
of this bleſſed Name of God engaged for his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and for the fuller aſſurance of the Soul of all that the Goſpel diſcovers to it. This may be opened two wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In general. 2. More particularly, diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the particular ſecurity the Soul may have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all fears and ſcruples, that is poſſible for the Soul to apprehend in its ſecurity.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In general it appears, That the Soul may behold the Credit of the Lords Name engaged for his ſecurity and aſſurance, in regard there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that the Goſpel diſcovers unto Souls, but the ſame is included in the bleſſed Name of God. Two things follow from hence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Soul may be aſſured that there is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of the Lords changing that his ever bleſſed Name. The Word is gone out of the mouth of God, that that's <hi>his Name for ever, and that is his Memorial to all Generations.</hi> Thence the Soul may aſſure it ſelf, that though <hi>Heaven and Earth paſs away,</hi> and melt like wax, yet not one Title of what the Goſpel diſcovers can poſſibly fall to the ground, ſeeing it is impoſſible that the higheſt Majeſty of Heaven and Earth can change.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From thence the Soul may conclude, That thete is a Neceſſity for the bleſſed God to deny himſelf, and to trample under his feet his deareſt Glory, if the leaſt Title of whatever the Goſpel reveals, ſhould fail, ſeeing all is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his Name for ever.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Soul may behold through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, the Credit of the Lords Name to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for his ſecurity of what the Goſpel diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:48673:154"/>
in particular, againſt all fears and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Credit and Honour of the Lords Name is engaged, That there can be no depth of miſery ſo deep, as relief and ſuccour ſhould not be in Chriſt for the poor, periſhing, ſinking Soul. That's the very firſt Title of the Lords Honour, that concurs to make up his Name: <hi>He is merciful;</hi> that is, he hath bowels of mercy for Souls in the depth of the greateſt miſery. Thence the Soul may conclude, that the honour of that bleſſed Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the Lords Name muſt fail, that Link in the Golden Chain muſt be cut aſunder, ſhould the moſt unſpeakable depth of miſery that ever Soul was plunged in, be a caſe hopeleſs or helpleſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Credit and Honour of the Lords ever bleſſed Mame is engaged, that there may be a free receiving of the moſt loveleſs Soul into love and favour, that hath nothing but what is abominable to the bleſſed pure eyes of God within him. You ſee the ſecond Title of his Honour is <hi>The Lord Gracious;</hi> that is, receiving into favour freely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving wretches, undeſired wretches, without reſpect to any thing in them: So that when the poor ſcrupulous Soul ſhall begin to fear that there is not ground enough in the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt for him to roll himſelf into that bleſſed open bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of the Lords love in Chriſt, with a confidence of the willingneſs of the Lord to accept his love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Soul into favour, then he may behold the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and Honour of his Name to be engaged for the Souls ſecurity, to aſſure it that the moſt forlorn Soul, that is nothing elſe but Sin, that can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but ſin, may be freely admitted into that
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:48673:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>
boſom of his love, to be an object of all favour, and all kindneſs whatſoever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Credit and Honour of the Lords bleſſed Name is engaged for the bearing with the moſt crooked Soul in his crookedneſs for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and his waiting to receive the moſt crooked Soul into favour and love. The Name of the Lord you ſee is <hi>Long-ſuffering;</hi> that is, he that bears long before he executes any wrath. Hence the Credit of the Lords Name is engaged to ſecure Souls of what the Goſpel reveals in three particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) To ſecure the Sinner of acceptance into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that hath moſt deſperately and rebelliouſly for a long time neglected Grace and Mercy.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Hence the Credit of the Lords Name is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for the continuance of his Favour towards the moſt crooked perverſe heart, notwithſtanding his crookedneſs. So that the Goſpel reveals an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility for Sin or all the Powers of Hell to force the Soul from the bleſſed boſom of the Lords love in Chriſt, where it hath once taken up its reſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Credit of the Lords Name is engaged to ſecure the empty Soul of all fulneſs of Grace and Mercy that is ſutable to his neceſſity, to be contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the boſom of God in Chriſt for the Soul em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing him. The Goſpel ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8. there is <hi>unſearchable riches in Chriſt;</hi> and the Lord calls his Name <hi>Abundant in goodneſs:</hi> what is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between theſe two? Riches is nothing but goodneſs, or good things conſidered as they are in abundance; and you ſee the Lords Name is called <hi>Abundant in goodneſs.</hi> So that here the Credit of the Lords Name is engaged to ſecure the Soul againſt all that can poſſibly be objected, in regard
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:48673:155" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his own emptineſs, poverty, and nothingneſs. So that,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In caſe the Soul fears it hath no ſtrength to yield obedience to what the Lord commands, and thereupon begins to fear that all the Goſpel diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to him ſhall be made of no effect; preſently through believing the Soul may behold, not only that the Goſpel hath reveal'd a fulneſs of all goodnes (and ſo ſtrength it ſelf to the Soul) but he may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Lord to have called himſelf by that Name of <hi>Abundant in Goodneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Soul is ſecured by the Credit of the Lords Name, againſt all fears of his not prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God in Chriſt to be partaker of that Mercy, and Love and Goodneſs that the Goſpel diſcovers. He may behold the Lords Name to be <hi>Abundant in Goodneſs;</hi> not only goodneſs, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding, having more than a fulneſs; ſo that it ſhould run over into empty Souls, like Rivers aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with water, freely overflowing his Banks.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Credit of the Lords Name is engaged to a compleat, perfect fulfilling of his revealing mercy and goodneſs towards loveleſs Sinners. His Name you ſee is <hi>Abundant in Truth.</hi> So that God muſt loſe that Beam of the glory of his bleſſed Name, which is <hi>Abundant in Truth,</hi> ſhould the leaſt Tittle, the leaſt <hi>Iota</hi> of any word revealing Mercy and Love to loveleſs Sinners fall to the ground.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Credit of the Lords Name is engaged for the accepting every Soul into grace and favour diſcovered in the Goſpel, without making any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt any one Soul whatever. The Lords Name you ſee is, the <hi>Lord keeping Mercy for thouſands,</hi> that is, for infinite numbers. That is
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:48673:155"/>
to ſay, his Name is, he that is ready to ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to every Soul without exception.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Credit of the Lords Name is engaged, to ſecure Souls, that no kind or degree of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can be a prevention of his acceptance of a Soul into his favour and love. His Name you ſee is the <hi>Lord forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin,</hi> that is, forgiving all kinds and degrees of ſin.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Credit and Honour of the Lords Name is engaged, that the ground of his receiving Souls into love and favour ſhall be only his own precious will. His Name is, <hi>He will have mercy upon whom he will have mercy,</hi> Exod. 33.9. So that when the Souls confidence begins to waver about the Lords willingneſs to accept him into love and favour, becauſe he beholds no ground or argument of love, then the Soul may behold the bleſſed Name of God, that <hi>hath mercy upon whom he will have mercy,</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for no Arguments of his love and mercy, but his own Will. Thus you ſee that the Credit of the Lords bleſſed Name is engaged for aſſuring Souls of whatever the Goſpel diſcovers. And that's the Sixth Particular.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The Spirit reveals the Lord to have given in his bleſſed word Preſidents, Examples and Patterns, ſutable to the Caſe and State of every Soul, upon whom the Lord hath already effected whatever mercy and love the Goſpel diſcovers to forlorn, deſpicable, loveleſs Sinners. The Lord hath ſo abounded and ſuperabounded in the riches of his own love, that out of the bowels of thoſe his compaſſions towards loveleſs Sinners, he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended beneath himſelf and his own ſuper-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Majeſty, to give all kind of ſecurities what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:48673:156"/>
are poſſible to be given to poor doubting Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits concerning his Goſpel-love. There are eight particular Caſes wherein the Lord hath given Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns and Examples unto Souls; which Caſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all kinds of Eſtates and Tempers, that it is poſſible for any Soul to be under.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In the caſe of the ſuperlative height of Souls wickedneſs, the being plunged into a bottomleſs Ocean of all kind of abominations and pollutions that are imaginable. In this caſe the Lord hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven eminent patterns.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If you look into that place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. and read over the black bill of almoſt all kind of abominations that are there reckoned up, <hi>Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, Idolaters, Adulterers, Effeminate, abuſers of themſelves with mankind, Theeves, Covetous, Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, Revilers, Extortioners:</hi> And you ſhall ſee <hi>v.</hi> 11. that ſome that are contained in the black bill of all pollutions, <hi>were Waſhed, Sanctified, Juſtified, in the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> all Goſpel mercy and love was diſcovered unto them; for ſaith the Text, <hi>Such were ſome of you.</hi> Another pattern the Lord left, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.11, 12, 13. of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> who heaped up wickedneſs upon wickedneſs, yet the Lord made him a pattern of Goſpel-love and mercy. Another you have in <hi>Paul,</hi> in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>One drinking up the blood of Saints like water,</hi> one blaſpheming Jeſus Chriſt, offering all kind of injuries and indignities to the name of Chriſt, and yet the Lord did ſhew forth all long-ſuffering, that is all kind of love, manifeſted in patience and forbearance, and admitted him into union and communion with himſelf through Chriſt; and this he did on purpoſe that he might leave it as an experiment of his Love and Mercy to them
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:48673:156"/>
who ſhould hereafter believe on him to life everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So <hi>Act.</hi> 2.30. thoſe that had waſhed their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and envious Hands, in the innocent blood of the Lord Jeſus, were not excluded from Goſpel Mercy and Love. So if you look into the doleful ſtory of our firſt fall, by <hi>Eve</hi> who did firſt provoke the anger and indignation of God, yet ſhe was made a pattern of Goſpel Mercy and Love, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond caſe wherein God hath given patterns is in the caſe of unbelief, the potency and prevalency of unbelieving diſpoſitions. I ſhall propound but two patterns to you in this caſe: Firſt of <hi>David,</hi> who under the rage of unbelief, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.11. <hi>ſaid in his haſt, all men are liers;</hi> that thoſe Prophets that had revealed to him from the mouth of God that he ſhould inherit the Kingdom were but diſſemblers, notwithſtanding he had been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of the truth of the meſſage coming from God. The ſecond pattern is in unbelieving <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, John</hi> 20.24, 25, 26. that would not believe the reſurrection of Chriſt, <hi>except he ſhould ſee in his Hands the print of the nailes, and thruſt his Hands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſide;</hi> yet Goſpel Love and Mercy was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. under this caſe come in theſe two caſes of Souls, wherein they are much perplexed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In caſe of the Souls not feeling the Lord by his Almighty power, drawing their Hearts to believe. Saith the poor perplexed Soul, ſurely the Lord draws all that he intends ſhould come to Chriſt through believing; but alas, ſaith the Soul, I do not ſee that God hath drawn my Heart, therefore ſurely God hath not choſen me to be an object of Goſpel Grace and Love; now the Spirit may wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:48673:157"/>
from hence, that there hath been a Soul as much under the dominion of unbelieving diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as his unbelieving Spirit, yet the bowels of Love and Mercy revealed in the Goſpel were not reſtrained from them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here comes in that caſe of the weakneſs of affections and deſires towards believing, and of the ſtrong inclination of the Spirit, to receive ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the Lords willingneſs to make him the object of Goſpel Mercy and Love, from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that ſhould be viſible and ſenſible to the Soul. Thats alſo a common caſe of Souls, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcern any diſpoſition in their Hearts, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Lords willingneſs to receive them into the boſom of his Mercy and Love, revealed in the Goſpel, from the bare word of God alone, but if they could ſee any fruit of that Love and Mercy in their boſoms, then they think they ſhould believe. You ſee the Spirit hath here in this caſe alſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced the Lord to have afforded a real experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Mercy and Love to a Soul; in the caſe of unbelieving <hi>Thomas,</hi> who was not only incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſee ground of believing in a viſible way, from the ſight of his Eyes, and the feelings of his Hands; but he was reſolved to have it that way or no way: unleſs I ſee thus and thus, I will not believe.</p>
               <p n="3">III. A third caſe wherein the Lord hath given preſidents, is in the caſe of loathſom, horrible, dreadful and moſt hateful imaginations working in the Heart againſt God. In this caſe the Lord hath not left himſelf without ſome experimental witneſs of the diſcovery of his Mercy and Love. Now the caſe being very high, I find an experiment of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:48673:157"/>
Mercy and Love, diſcovered in a caſe that is as high. In this caſe the Lord hath left Jeſus Chriſt himſelf as a pattern, his Heart and Spirit was perplexed and troubled with as hateful, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible imaginations propounded to him, as ever were propounded to any Soul; in <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.6, 9. the <hi>Devil</hi> propounded to him that he ſhould mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, caſt thy ſelf down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That he ſhould preſume upon his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers promiſe to him, and be careleſs of walking according to his Fathers will; ſaith the Devil, <hi>He hath ſaid that his Angels ſhould have charge over him, leaſt he ſhould daſh his foot againſt a ſtone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a third ſort of thoughts propounded to his imagination worſe then theſe, and that is that he ſhould worſhip the Devil: What more hateful and horrible thoughts could be injected into any boſom than this, to worſhip the Devil himſelf? Now under this general are comprehended theſe two particular caſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is comprehended the caſes of all blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous thoughts, that are wont to perplex di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Souls. That if a Soul ſhould ſay within himſelf, ſure never any object of the Lords Love ever had ſuch helliſh thoughts, as are preſented to my mind, ſuch thoughts as my Heart trembles to name; the Spirit may then bring to the Souls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance this pretious pattern of Chriſt; the Devil injecting into his pure mind, thoughts that were as dreadfully derogatory to the honour of the Lords higheſt Majeſty, thoughts that had as much of the poiſon of Hell in them, as ever thought that was injected into thy curſed Heart.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:48673:158"/>2. Under this comes in all kind of Temptations concerning ſelf murder, or ſelf deſtruction. In this caſe the Spirit may bring to remembrance the Lord Chriſt himſelf, as the Souls preſident or pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, the Lords letting him be perplexed with temptations of the ſame kind.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. A fourth caſe is the want of all ſenſible manifeſtations of God to the Soul, either in quickning and reviving, or in comforting. In this caſe you may take the dearly beloved one of God, <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 22. (wherein indeed he ſpeaks typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally relating to Chriſt eſpecially, yet alſo ſpeaks but the thoughts of his own Spirit at that time too) ſaith he, <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? Why art thou ſo far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 14. ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.3, 4. <hi>I remembred God, and was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, I complained and my Spirit was overwhelmed, &amp;c.</hi> Another pattern the Lord gives us of the Holy man <hi>Job,</hi> he cries out, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.4. <hi>The arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poiſon whereof drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up my Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.24, 25, 26. <hi>Wherefore hideſt thou thy face, and holdeſt me for thine enemy? &amp;c.</hi> Now under this come in two particular caſes of the Soul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The caſe of the defect of all the workings of the quickning Spirit into the Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Under this comes in the caſe of the Souls wanting the manifeſting light of the Spirit, to reveal the Goſpel in its beauty and glory to its Soul. So that if any Soul wanting this manifeſting light of the Spirit, ſhould begin to caſt off all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and to waver, and ſtagger, and doubt, leaſt the Lord ſhould not be willing to accept it
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:48673:158"/>
to be an object of Goſpel love; then the Spirit may, and doth ſometimes bring to remembrance theſe eminent patterns, of thoſe who were in the very ſame temper, under the ſame wants, and yet they were really the objects of that love and mercy that the Goſpel in Chriſt reveals.</p>
               <p n="5">V. A fifth caſe is the caſe of fruitleſneſs, inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of the breathings of the Soul after God in prayer. In this caſe alſo the Lord hath given emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent patterns: Thoſe two forenamed ones, both <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> you ſhall find to have been in the ſame caſe, <hi>Job</hi> 23.8, 9. <hi>Behold I go forward, but he is not there, and backward, but I cannot perceive him, on the left hand where he doth work, but I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, &amp;c.</hi> His meaning is, he uſed all kind of means, the utmoſt diligence in ſeeking after God, but he would not be found. So if you look upon <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 22.2. <hi>O my God I cry in the day time, but thou heareſt not, and in the night ſeaſon I am not ſilent.</hi> So that here God ſhews Souls an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome who were in the ſame caſe, and yet objects of his love and mercy.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. A ſixth caſe is the inability of the Soul to pour out requeſts. That in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.17. will ſhew the Lord to have left his whole Church as a pattern in that caſe; <hi>Why haſt thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardned our hearts from thy fear?</hi> Theſe Souls complain of the Lords ſuffering ſuch ſenſleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and blockiſhneſs of Spirit to be upon them, as made them unſutable for every duty of the Lords worſhip, and yet notwithſtanding theſe were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of mercy and love.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. A ſeventh caſe is the beholding all argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are poſſible to be imagined in a Soul,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:48673:159"/>
againſt thoſe promiſes of love and mercy that the Goſpel tenders. In this caſe the Lord hath given that pretious pattern of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom he choſe to be the pattern of all believers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18, 19. <hi>He againſt hope believed in hope;</hi> that is, againſt all ground and reaſon, and arguments of hope that could be imagined. Though he ſaw all poſſibility againſt that promiſe of love and mercy, that the Lord had given him concerning the Meſſiah to come through his loins, to be his lawful ſeed by <hi>Sarah,</hi> yet notwithſtanding he believed, though he ſaw his own body dead, and the deadneſs of <hi>Sarahs</hi> womb, yet it is ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 20. he ſtaggered not at the promiſe through unbelief, his Spirit did not ſo much as waver. Under this general may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended theſe three particular caſes of the Soul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The caſe of the Souls thinking himſelf to be the moſt unlikely under Heaven, to be an object of Goſpel mercy and love. The Soul conſidering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a poor deſpicable uſeleſs wretch, a low contemptible worm, not having any thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to be ſerviceable for the Lords honour as others have; yea, being far deeper drenched into ſin than other Souls are: Here is a pattern the Lord hath made to ſtand upon ſacred Record, of his fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a promiſe of mercy and love, notwithſtanding all unlikelihood that can be imagined.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Under this comes in that particular caſe of the Souls inability, and inſufficiency to receive and embrace that mercy and love the Goſpel reveals, according as the Lord requires. That is, when the Soul in gazing upon thoſe bleſſed tenders of love and mercy, begins to ſay within it ſelf, I am ſo dead
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:48673:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in ſin, that I have not the leaſt ability to receive that mercy and love tendered, according as God requires; and therefore I ſhall never be the object of Goſpel mercy and love, ſeeing I cannot receive it. Now in this caſe alſo, this pretious pattern that the Lord hath given of <hi>Abraham,</hi> may be brought to the Souls remembrance by the Spirit, to teſtifie that the Lords promiſe of mercy and love to <hi>Abraham,</hi> was fulfilled when he was in the ſame caſe, when he could do nothing, had not the leaſt ability and power to effect what was neceſſary to be effected by him, for the fulfilling of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Under this comes in that particular caſe, of the Souls beholding nothing but oppoſition in his Heart, againſt that mercy and love that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel reveals. So that if the Soul ſhould begin to ſay within it ſelf, it cannot be that he ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by God to be an object of that Goſpel mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and love, ſeeing his Heart nothing elſe but ſpeaks againſt it: Then the Spirit may bring to the Souls remembrance, that which the Lord gave as a promiſe of mercy and love unto <hi>Abraham, He againſt hope believed in hope:</hi> There was not only no hope, but all things againſt hope of that promiſe being fulfilled to him, that he might be a pattern of believing.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. There is an eighth caſe of wretched, treacherous backſliding from God, after mutual cloſures and embraces between God and the Soul. In this caſe the Lord hath given pretious preſidents of his Goſpel love and mercy, that have been communicated unto Souls ſo backſliding. You may firſt look upon <hi>Aaron's</hi> caſe, who was none of
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:48673:160"/>
the leaſt backſliders, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Aaron</hi> that had made choiſe of God alone to be his God, here became a wretched backſlider from the pure worſhip of God according to his own will, to an Idolatrous worſhip, to make a graven Image, (an Idol after the manner of <hi>Egypt</hi>) and to make an Altar too, ſtill all contrary to the way of the Lords worſhip: And yet if you look into <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.12, 13. you ſhall find this very <hi>Aaron,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this backſliding, taken to be an object of that love and mercy, ſo as to be choſen Miniſter of the Lords Sanctuary, to be of the very higheſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Lords worſhip here below, to be made the moſt immediate type of repreſenting Jeſus Chriſt, that bleſſed true High Prieſt. Another pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of backſliding you may behold in <hi>Solomon,</hi> in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 7.11. <hi>He built an high place for</hi> Chemoſh, <hi>the abomination of</hi> Moab: yet this backſlider not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding was an object of his ſpecial Goſpel love and mercy, as appears <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.32, 33. <hi>My love will I never take from him.</hi> I need not name <hi>Peters</hi> caſe, and <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, it is known to you all. You ſee it is apparent, the Lord hath given eminent patterns in this caſe of the Souls backſliding. So that herein many particular caſes of Souls come in, as the caſe of negligence and ſlightneſs of Heart towards God; the caſe of eſtrangeneſs from God, after it once taſted of communion with him: The caſe of all kind of wretchedneſs that the Soul can call to remembrance againſt it ſelf, or that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly the Soul can be guilty of, after the injoyment of the diſcovery of the Lords love and mercy in the Lord Jeſus to him. So that in caſe upon any ſuch ground as the Souls wretched, wicked dealing
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:48673:160"/>
with God, after union and communion with him, and its turning aſide from God, the Soul ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer its Confidence to waver concerning the will of God to accept his loveleſs backſliding Soul into the boſom of his love and mercy, then the Spirit may bring to its remembrance thoſe precious par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns that the Lord hath given concerning his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of ſuch backſliding wretches, after ſuch diſcoveries of himſelf. That's the ſeventh Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular that the Spirit may reveal, and bring to Souls remembrance, to ſhew that the Lord hath given Security upon Security, abundance and ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Security, to aſſure Souls of what the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel reveals,</p>
            </div>
            <div n="305-399" type="pages">
               <p>Eighthly, The laſt particular that the Spirit brings to the Souls remembrance, or doth or may reveal to it is this; That there are peculiar, near invaluable Engagements upon God himſelf, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of himſelf, to fulfil thoſe precious Goſpel-Diſcoveries to every Soul that ſhall embrace or accept them. The Lord out of his incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible wiſdom, hath ſo curiouſly contrived that Goſpel-love to loveleſs Sinners, that he hath ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interwoven his own intereſt with their intereſt: And certainly the Lord hath revealed his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt thus to be in the compleating of his Goſpel-love and mercy to loveleſs Sinners, that ſhall em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him, on purpoſe to ſecure their wavering, unſtable Spirits, and to ſettle them in a more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of confidence in Chriſt, that their Spirits might be filled with <hi>joy and peace through believing.</hi> The engagements that are upon God himſelf, in reſpect of himſelf, to fulfil Goſpel-love and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:48673:161"/>
to Sinners that ſhall embrace him, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt Engagement upon God himſelf, in regard of himſelf, from whence Souls may have ſecurity, is this; That the Lord hath choſen every ſuch particular loveleſs Sinner as ſhall accept of his Goſpel-diſcovery, to be one of his own Family, and his own Houſhold. Hence you ſhall find in <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.15. That all Believers are called but <hi>one Family.</hi> And they are called the <hi>Houſhold of God, Eph.</hi> 2.19. And in <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.6. The whole Church is called <hi>The Houſe of Chriſt.</hi> Now what abundant ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity may the believing Soul receive concerning fulfilling Goſpel-diſcoveries, from the Spirits bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to remembrance this Engagement of God in reſpect of himſelf, to fulfil Goſpel-diſcoveries.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From hence the Soul may behold through believing, God himſelf to be engaged to remove all Jars, Differences, Breaches and Diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from himſelf and every Soul that ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe Goſpel-diſcoveries. From thence the Soul may argue ſweetly within his own Spirit, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Objections and Scruples concerning its Rebellion and Diſobedience, and ſay thus, Will not the God of Peace have peace in his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, in his own Houſhold?</p>
               <p n="2">2. From thence the believing Soul may behold the Lord engaged to compleat and perfect a work of Sanctification in his own Soul, if he will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Goſpel-diſcovery, though he be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unclean, though he be polluted in the moſt ſuperlative degree. The Soul may argue within
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:48673:161"/>
its own Spirit thus, Seeing every Soul that will embrace Goſpel-diſcoveries, is choſen to be one of the Lords Houſhold, his own Family, ſurely the Lords Family ſhall be all ſutable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thence the Soul may diſcern the Lord to be engaged to communicate all ſutable love and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to his poor needy Spirit. The Soul may ſay within it ſelf, Seeing every Soul that ſhall embrace or accept Goſpel-diſcoveries, is choſen to be one of the Lords Family, ſurely there can be no provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion wanting for the Family of God himſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hence the Soul may diſcern through believing, God to be engaged to accompliſh, perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the whole work of Salvation, againſt all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments whatever, if his Soul will embrace thoſe Goſpel-diſcoveries. The Soul may ſay within it ſelf, Seeing every Soul that will embrace the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-diſcoveries, is choſen to be of the Family and Houſhold of God, it is beyond the power of Hell and the corrupt heart, to deprive the Lord of any of his own Family.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Second Engagement that is laid upon God in reſpect of himſelf, to fulfil Goſpel-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries unto loveleſs Sinners embracing him, is, That every particular deſpicable Sinner accepting Goſpel-diſcoveries is choſen by God himſelf to be one of his peculiar Children. According to that in <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God.</hi> They are called Chriſts <hi>Brethren,</hi> John 20.17. Now what full compleat Security may every Soul through believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing receive from thence!</p>
               <p>And here firſt, I ſhall open to you what full Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:48673:162"/>
Souls may have for the fulfilling every Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-diſcovery to them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What ſecurity they may have of theſe Goſpel-diſcoveries being fulfilled to them, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry caſe that it is poſſible for them to be in, when the Goſpel-diſcovery ſhall come to them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We ſhall ſhew you what ſecurity Souls may have for the fulfilling every Goſpel-diſcovery to them, from the Engagement.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From hence the Soul through believing, may diſcern the Lord to be engaged to accept every for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn Sinner that will accept theſe Goſpel-diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, into the neareſt union and conjunction of Love that is poſſible,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence it may behold the Lord engaged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive its forlorn Soul into that near union of Love, though there is nothing that is amiable in it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence it may behold the Lord engaged to communicate all fulneſs of love and mercy that the poor empty Soul ſhall be capable of, if it will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept theſe Goſpel-diſcoveries, If the Soul be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to be one of the Lords Children, it is choſen to be an <hi>Heir,</hi> Rom. 8.17.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Soul may behold the Lord engaged to an everlaſting unchangeable continuance of all love and favour to it in its embracing theſe Goſpel-diſcoveries.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Hence the Soul may have a fulneſs of Security for the fulfilling thoſe precious Goſpel-diſcoveries to it, in whatever caſe it is poſſible for any Soul to be in, to whom theſe Goſpel-diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries come.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In caſe of deſperate wickedneſs, and great unworthineſs. In this caſe the Soul may have Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:48673:162"/>
and behold the Lord engaged in reſpect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> himſelf, to fulfil thoſe Goſpel-diſcoveries to it, notwithſtanding his ſuperlative degree of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and higheſt unworthineſs. The Soul may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus, Will not a tender-hearted Father accept a poor rebellious Child to Amity, Love and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with himſelf, though he have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious in the higheſt degree?</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the caſe of the moſt horrible Temptations. The worſt the Soul can imagine of it ſelf in this caſe, is this; That through ſome accurſed wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs it ſhould wilfully caſt away its own Soul, and join in League and Amity with thoſe infernal powers; and ſuppoſe this, yet from hence the Soul may diſcern the Lord engaged to fulfil all his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-diſcoveries of love and mercy to his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Soul in this caſe, if he will accept thoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-diſcoveries.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence it may have Security in the ſaddeſt damps, ſtraitneſs, and deadneſs, and indiſpoſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that ever poſſeſſed any Soul in Prayer. The Soul may ſay, Suppoſe a tender-hearted Father ſhould have a beloved Child that is ſick and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered, that he cannot ſo much as ſpeak to him for ſuccour, but look upon his Fathers face with watery eyes, with ſighs and groans, what thinkeſt thou, O my Soul, would not the deareſt pangs of compaſſion in the Father be working to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Child?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hence the Soul may have full Security for fulfilling Goſpel-diſcoveries into his boſom, though he be in that doleful ſtate of captivity to an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving heart, void of all ſenſible viſible diſpoſitions in his Spirit. The Soul in this caſe may, and ought
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:48673:163"/>
to argue within it ſelf thus; O my Soul, it is true indeed, thou haſt neither power nor diſpoſition in thee, to yield obedience to the precious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the ever bleſſed God, who commands thee to accept of love and mercy tendered to thy loveleſs Soul in the Lord Jeſus, but doſt thou think it poſſible that thy want of power to believe, ſhould prevent the Lords acceptance of thee into the boſom of his fatherly affection? Yea, I may add more in this caſe, from this engagement of God to fulfil Goſpel-diſcoveries, the Soul may behold him engaged to contribute believing diſpoſitions.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Soul may have full Security concerning the fulfilling the Goſpel-diſcoveries to it ſelf, though it be in the caſe of ſlavery and vaſſallage to the moſt crooked, untoward, perverſe heart that ever dwelt in any Son or Daughter of <hi>Adam.</hi> It may thus ſay, O my Soul, is it poſſible for thy crookedneſs to have an influence upon the heart of the immutable unchangeable God, to blot out the Name that is written there from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, if thou wilt accept Goſpel-Diſcoveries?</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Soul from hence hath full ſecurity of the fulfilling all Goſpel-diſcoveries into his boſom, though it be in the ſaddeſt backſliding caſe from what his Spirit was once allured to, that ever any was guilty of, ſince the firſt Apoſtacy from God in the Loins of <hi>Adam.</hi> Now may it ſay, O my backſliding Soul, hath not the bleſſed Redeemer of poor loveleſs Sinners, ſaid in <hi>Luke</hi> 15. That the Bleſſed Father will <hi>run</hi> to receive ſuch a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding wretch as thou art? He will <hi>fall on his neck and kiſs him,</hi> and call to the Angels to <hi>rejoyce</hi> at his Return. And then may the Soul add, and
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:48673:163"/>
ſhall not he that dwelt in the boſom of the Father from eternity, be credited by thy Soul?</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third Engagement upon God the Spirit may or doth remember the Soul of is, That every Soul that will and ſhall embrace the precious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-diſcoveries, is choſen from eternity into the Order of Royal Prieſthood, whereof Jeſus Chriſt himſelf is Head or High Prieſt. Thence we are ſaid to be <hi>Kings and Prieſts unto God,</hi> Rev. 16. And to be <hi>a Royal Prieſthood,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9. Now from hence the Soul through believing, may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern God engaged to fulfill to the uttermoſt all the precious Goſpel-diſcoveries to every Soul that ſhall accept them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thereby God is engaged by his deareſt love to his own delight and contentment in the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all his holy things here below, to make the perſon of every Soul that ſhall accept Goſpel-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, to be compleatly acceptable and well pleaſing in his own eyes. The delight of the Lord in every act of his own Worſhip, hath its primary dependence upon the delight that the Lord takes in the Worſhippers, as in <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.10. Saith the Lord to them, <hi>I have no pleaſure in you, neither will I accept an offering at your hand:</hi> Their perſons were not amiable in Gods eyes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their offering could not be acceptable. And ſo it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord had reſpect to</hi> Abel, <hi>and to his Offering:</hi> It was through the reſpect the Lord had to <hi>Abel</hi>'s perſon, that he had any reſpect to his Offering. So that now ſeeing the Lord hath predeſtinated every ſuch Soul accepting Goſpel-diſcoveries, to be a Prieſt to miniſter to himſelf in all his holy things, ſhould not the Lord make
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:48673:164"/>
the perſon of every ſuch Soul compleatly accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in his own eyes, he muſt rob himſelf of all his Contentment and delight he ſhould take in all his holy things here below.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hereby the Lord is engaged by his tender care of preſerving his holy things from pollution, to purifie, cleanſe and ſanctifie the moſt unclean polluted Soul that ſhall accept thoſe Goſpel-diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries. Every approach to God with an uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed heart, was accounted by God a pollution of his own Sanctuary, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.7. And likewiſe the Lord accounts every approach to himſelf by an unregenerate and unſanctified heart, now in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-times, to be a pollution of any Ordinance whatever that the ſoul maketh his approach to God in. This the Lord typically ſignified to his Church in its minority, in the manner of the conſecrating the Prieſts to himſelf that were to offer thoſe Legal Sacrifices, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1.6. When <hi>Moſes</hi> conſecrated <hi>Aaron and his Sons,</hi> he <hi>waſhed them;</hi> which ſignified the cleanſing of them from pollutions; the Lord intending to reveal this, that they were only ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, cleanſed, purified hearts, who were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to offer any Spiritual Sacrifice, that ſhould be acceptable in his eyes. Neither muſt you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this to be a bare revelation to Souls of what their hearts ought to be in their approach to God; but it is alſo a revelation what the Lord intended they ſhould be, <hi>through his mighty power working in their hearts.</hi> Now hence the Spirit may give the Soul full ſecurity, concerning the fulfilling Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-diſcoveries to it, in its embracing and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:48673:164"/>1. When the heart is ſtaggering and wavering, in regard of the want of all holy, enlivened, heavenly diſpoſitions in his Spirit, and finding uncleanneſs and filthineſs. The Spirit may here reveal the Lord to be engaged, that in caſe the polluted unclean heart of his ſhall accept Goſpel-Diſcoveries, it ſhall be ſanctified, cleanſed, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the ſtrength and tyrannizing power of any curſed Luſt is cauſing the Soul to queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther love and mercy revealed for loveleſs ſinners, that will accept it, ſhould be made out to his Soul in his embracing it; The Spirit may here diſcover the Lord as well to be engaged in the Souls reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon him, to make him the Object of that love and mercy, to cleanſe his Soul from that curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pollution, to deliver it from under the tyranny of ſuch a helliſh diſpoſition, as well as to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to make out love and mercy to the Soul in any other kind whatever.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A Fourth Engagement the Lord hath laid upon himſelf for the fulfilling Goſpel-diſcoveries, is this; That every Soul accepting thoſe Goſpel-diſcoveries, is the peculiar choſen Veſſel of the Lords moſt ſuperlative mercies and compaſſions. This you may ſee in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23. <hi>That he might make known the riches of his Glory on the veſſels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto Glory.</hi> You may obſerve that every called Soul, that is, every Soul anſwering thoſe ſweet, Soul-melting invitations of the Goſpel of the Lord Jeſus, is here affirmed to be a <hi>Veſſel of mercy prepared</hi> by God himſelf from eternity for that very end. Now from hence the Spirit may give abundant ſecurity to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:48673:165"/>
ſcrupulous Soul, of the infallible fulfilling of all the Goſpel-diſcoveries to every Soul that ſhall embrace them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Herein the Spirit may manifeſt the Lord to be engaged by his intire and infinite love, to his own glory and mercy, to redeem and deliver every Soul that is plunged into the moſt bottomleſs depth of ſin and miſery, if he will and ſhall accept thoſe pretious Goſpel-diſcoveries to it. So that the Lord through his own admirable contrivance of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of love towards loveleſs forlorn ſinners, hath ſo intereſted himſelf in the perfecting of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious deſign, that he ſtands engaged as ſtrongly and powerfully to give perfect redemption and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance to loſt ſinners, that ſhall embrace Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-diſcoveries, as he ſtands engaged to maintain and ſupport the honour of thoſe his glorious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of his own mercy and compaſſion.</p>
               <p>Now there are three things wherein the honour of the Lords mercy conſiſts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In the free workings of it towards the moſt miſerable objects, that are the moſt unworthy of any pitty and compaſſion that can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the tranſcendency of its operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or motions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the infinite Almighty power of its workings, towards ſuch unworthy objects of it. Thats thus, it hath ſuch an Almighty power in it, not only to ſuccour and relieve thoſe periſhing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done ones in their miſery, but alſo to confer the higheſt degree of all happineſs upon them. Now the honour of the Lords mercy and compaſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in this; hence the Lord ſtands engaged by
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:48673:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his deareſt love, to that honour of this his mercy, to give perfect redemption to the Soul, that is plunged in the moſt unfathomed depth of ſin and miſery, if the Soul ſhall and will embrace thoſe Goſpel-diſcoveries.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence the Spirit may manifeſt the Lord to be engaged, by the inſeperable properties of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, to communicate a fulneſs of all mercy and compaſſion, to every Soul accepting thoſe Goſpel-diſcoveries. The Eſſential property of the Divine nature, is to be iſſuing forth the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs depths of perfection that are included in it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the boſom of poor needy empty penurious ones. It is as natural to the Divine nature to be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating of its own perfections, as it is natural for the Sun to ſend forth its own pretious raies: And then this being the very nature of the Eſſence and being of any good, by how much the higher the goodneſs of any thing is, by ſo much the more ſtrongly is it inclined and diſpoſed to the communicating of himſelf: So that goodneſs it ſelf in its perfection, being in the Divine nature; thence it is that it is the inſeparable property of the Divine nature to be communicating all its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, ſo far as they are communicable. Now thence the Spirit may cauſe the Soul to conclude, that ſeeing it is the property of the Divine nature to communicate all its perfections, (ſo far as they can be communicable) and alſo ſeeing every Soul embracing Goſpel-diſcoveries, is the proper object to which that perfection of the Lords mercy and compaſſion is to be communicated; thence the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may cauſe the Soul to conclude, that the Lord ſtands engaged by the inſeparable property of his
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:48673:166" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Divine nature, to make every ſuch Soul accepting Goſpel diſcoveries, to be the object of the higheſt mercy and compaſſion.</p>
               <p>Now from hence the Spirit may give the Soul full ſecurity, of the fulfilling the Goſpel diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into his boſom, whatever objections it is poſſible for the wiſdom of Hell and the corrupt Heart to make againſt it: All the objections that are poſſible to be imagined, by the extract and quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of all Wiſdom that is enmity againſt God, ſay no more but this concerning the Soul, that it is a miſerable loſt undone Soul: If the Soul objects the ſuperlative height of his own wickedneſs, if I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> object the long continuance in its wickedneſs, if it object the wretched contempt of mercy and love tendered, if it object the want of holineſs, the want of every good diſpoſition imaginable; if it object the moſt curſed crookedneſs and enmity of Heart againſt the bleſſed tenders of love, and begin to draw theſe concluſions from theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; therefore ſurely Goſpel diſcoveries cannot be fulfilled into my boſom, if I ſhould rely upon the Lord for the fulfilling of them; yet the Soul in all theſe objections ſays but this one thing, I am a poor miſerable deſpicable wretch in the depth of miſery: Now then the Spirit may manifeſt to the Soul, that in its accepting thoſe Goſpel diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, it ſhall be the proper object of all mercy and compaſſions: So that God ſhall be engaged by the inſeparable property of his own nature, to let out his tranſcendent bowels of mercy and compaſſion, in their freedom of working towards the Soul, ſo as to fill it with the fulneſs of mercy and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And thence the Spirit may convince the Soul,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:48673:166"/>
that either he muſt conclude that his finite miſery exceeds the infiniteneſs of the Lords mercies and compaſſions, or elſe the Soul muſt conclude that notwithſtanding all objections that can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yet in his accepting the Goſpel diſcoveries, they ſhall infallibly be fulfilled to the utmoſt into his boſom.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hereby the Spirit may manifeſt the Lord to be engaged by all his ſweeteſt contentments, his moſt pleaſing delight that he naturally takes, in beholding the workings of his own perfections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards poor imperfect creatures, to ſupply every want that can poſſibly be imagined to be in any Soul. As it is the property of the Lords nature to be diſpenſing of his fulneſs to empty ones; ſo it is the Lords infinite delight to behold thoſe ſtreams of his fulneſs, running down in a ſutable way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Souls. Now the Spirit may manifeſt the Lord to be engaged, by that his own contentment that he naturally takes in beholding his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections communicated unto others, to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate all ſutable ſuccour, relief, help and comfort, to every ſuch Soul as ſhall embrace thoſe Goſpel diſcoveries.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A fifth engagement the Lord hath laid upon himſelf, to fulfill Goſpel diſcoveries is, That every particular Soul that ſhall and will embrace Goſpel diſcoveries, is the peculiar choſen object of the Lords higheſt, moſt unſpeakable, everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and contentment. Thence it is that the Word reveals that the Lord taketh ſuch infinite pleaſure in his own, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.11. <hi>The Lord taketh pleaſure in thoſe that fear him, in thoſe that hope in his mercy:</hi> I pray obſerve it, in this is comprehended
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:48673:167"/>
every Soul that doth in the loweſt degree embrace Goſpel diſcoveries: This manifeſts that the Soul that doth in the moſt trembling timerous way, but reach out a feeble Hand of hope to lay hold upon that rich mercy tendered in the Lord Jeſus to it, is the object of the Lords pleaſure and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even thoſe Souls that are far from drawing any concluſion, only they caſt out the anchor of hope, and venture their loſt periſhing Souls upon the rock of mercy that is diſcovered in the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Spirit may reveal them to be the object of the higheſt moſt ſuperlative everlaſting delight and contentment; that is, the object of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt delight that God takes in any object out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: The ſame ſuperlative delight that the Father takes in Jeſus Chriſt as Mediator, he takes in the Soul united to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Every ſuch Soul is deſtinated to be the object wherein the Lord would as it were concenter to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one, all the bleſſed motions of his own delight and contentment. Jeſus Chriſt myſtically conſidered, that is, conſidered with his Body of holy Angels, and Souls of thoſe that were loſt ſinners united to him, is the very center wherein all the lines of the Lords delight and contentment meet perfectly together in one: Now every Soul embracing Goſpel diſcoveries, being taken into the perfect unity of the myſtical Body, becomes through its union into the myſtical Body, as it were a part of the center wherein all the lines of the delight of God meet together.</p>
               <p>There are four kinds of the Lords delight, that every ſuch Soul that embraceth Goſpel diſcoveries, is the choſen object of.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:48673:167"/>1. Every ſuch Soul is the choſen object of all the higheſt everlaſting delight of God, that he takes in the letting out his love in its perfection towards any thing without himſelf. The Lords moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral peculiar delight is in love, becauſe his Eſſence and being is love. Now every ſuch Soul is the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen object of the higheſt perfection of love, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as one of that myſtical Body: Hence it is ſaid, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.17. <hi>He will rejoyce over thee with joy, he will reſt in his love;</hi> that is to ſay, he will take ſatisfaction and contentment to his own Soul in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of thee; for indeed delight is nothing elſe but love in reſt, as deſire is love in motion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Every ſuch Soul ſo conſidered, is the object of all the moſt ſuperlative delight of God, that he takes in the actual communication of his goodneſs. It is ſo natural for God who is goodneſs it ſelf, to be communicating his goodneſs to others, that his Soul is filled with pleaſure and contentment, in the letting forth of his goodneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Every ſuch Soul embracing Goſpel diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, is the object of all the delights and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that the Lord takes in himſelf, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the tranſcendent glory of his own ſupereminent excellency. Now there are no other objects than that myſtical Body of Chriſt, that are the objects of any of the delights of God, that he takes from the contemplation of his own ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative glory, ſeeing his own excellencies that he contemplateth upon, are no other then he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth to that myſtical Body; So that all the delight, pleaſure and contentment that the Lord can receive from the pretious views of the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own glory, when he looks out of his
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:48673:168"/>
own boſom, it muſt ariſe only from that myſtical Body; and ſo conſequently the myſtical Body, being looked upon but as one, with one ſingle Eye, every Soul in that myſtical Body, may in the ſame ſence be ſaid to be the object of all the delight of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Every ſuch Soul as ſhall and will accept Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-diſcoveries, is the peculiar object of all the delights and contentments of God, that he takes from the contemplation of the reſult of the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal workings of his own wiſdom, in the diſpoſing of all things from the creation of the World, to its final diſſolution. It is the property of God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect as it were upon the workings of his own attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, as he did upon the whole world when he had made it, to behold how good it was, that he might delight himſelf in beholding the workings of his own excellency. Now the Lord only beholds the reſult of the admirable workings of all his attributes, in that myſtical Body of Chriſt: And ſo conſequently the myſtical Body only, is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his delight that he takes, in the reſult and iſſue and conſequence of the working of all his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes. Now the Spirit may and doth reveal from hence, that there are firm engagements laid upon God himſelf, to fulfil whatever the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel diſcovers to every Soul that ſhall embrace him.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Hence God is engaged by his expreſs Love to the content and ſatisfaction of his Soul, to let out his Love in the moſt abſolute, compleat, perfect, divine, unſpeakable workings of it, to every loveleſs ſinner, that doth embrace and accept Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-diſcoveries. So that from hence conſequently the Lord ſtands engaged.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:48673:168"/>Firſt, To let out his love to work freely with out motive, incentive, or argument inclining his love, to work towards every ſuch Soul embracing Goſpel Diſcoveries. The freedom of the working of his love towards ſouls, is one of the Divine Glorious Perfections of love, and ſhould that be wanting, ſome degree of the Lords own delight and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he hath reſolved to receive from every ſuch ſoul to himſelf, muſt alſo be wanting.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Thence the Lord ſtands engaged to let out his love wonderfully, beyond the comprehenſion of Men and Angels.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Thence he is engaged to let out the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of his love, to ſuch ſouls as ſhall embrace Goſpel Diſcoveries, fully, and compleatly, to the ſatisfaction of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, From hence alſo the Lord is engaged to let out his love, to work infinitely without meaſure, to every ſoul that ſhall embrace theſe Goſpel Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries. The love of God is but God himſelf, and therefore works not according to its perfection, till it works infinitely. Now from hence,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here is full ſecurity that the ſpirit may give any doubting Soul, concerning the fulfilling of the Goſpel Diſcoveries into his boſom, in his embracing of it, when the ſoul doth doubt becauſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſedneſs of his ſpirit, to any duty that the Lord requires of him, and becauſe of his inability to thoſe duties.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence the ſpirit may give full ſecurity to the Wavering Unſtable ſoul, who ſtands trembling leaſt he ſhould preſume, in caſting his Forlorn Loveleſs ſoul into thoſe everlaſting arms of Love, becauſe of the abominable Perverſeneſs, and Crookedneſs of his Heart againſt God in all things.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:48673:169"/>3. Hence the Spirit may give ſecurity to any wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Soul, whoſe hands as it were ſhake and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and dare not with any confidence graſp the bleſſed tender of Union and Communion with the Lord through Chriſt, becauſe of his wretched abuſe of the precious working of the Lords love towards him in Chriſt already.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Hence alſo the ſpirit may reveal the Lord to be engaged, by the ſame deareſt love to his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and ſatisfaction, to diſpoſe every ſoul that ſhall embrace Goſpel Diſcoveries, into a capacity for the injoyment of neereſt, moſt abſolute, intire Communion with himſelf. Under this particular, the Spirit may reveal the Lord to be engaged to theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To remove all the oppoſition unto Communion with him, that remains in any heart, to Suppreſs, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpower, yea to Heal all the Crookedneſs, and all the Averſeneſs of any Heart embracing Goſpel Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence the ſpirit may reveal the Lord to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to infuſe into the Soul ſuch Diſpoſitions, as ſhall be fully, compleatly ſutable to his own nature, ſo as to make ſo bleſſed a concurrence, between his own pureſt nature, and the Souls Corrupt nature; as that there ſhould be nothing in the nature of God himſelf oppoſite to the Souls Diſpoſition, nor nothing in the Souls Diſpoſition or nature oppoſite unto God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In this the Spirit may reveal the Lord to be engaged to heighten, or elevate and enlarge the faculties of the Soul, that are to receive thoſe Communications and Influences from God. Now what abundant ſecurity may the Spirit give to
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:48673:169"/>
any ſoul that trembles to embrace Goſpel Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, againſt fears!</p>
               <p n="1">1. What ſecurity may the Spirit give to Souls, fearing to give credit to thoſe Goſpel Diſcoveries, becauſe of the Averſeneſs and Contrariety of their Spirits unto Communion with God! Hence the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may ſay to every Soul without exception, that ſhall embrace Goſpel Diſcoveries, it is a choſen ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the higheſt eternal delight of God, in the Communication of his goodneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence the Spirit may give full ſecurity unto the Soul againſt all fears, becauſe of the Unſtable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Fickleneſs of his Heart, in any degree of Communion once attained.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence the ſpirit may give ſecurity fearing that the Goſpel Diſcoveries may not be Graſped and Embraced by the ſoul, becauſe of the Straitneſs and Narrowneſs of his Heart, void of all Thirſtings and Longings, yea of all Deſires. The Spirit may hence declare the Lord to be engaged, by his love to the pleaſure of his own Soul, to enlarge every ſuch Heart to a kind of infinite Capacity for Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Thence the Lord is engaged by his infinite Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation and Eſtimation of the delightful Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of his own Tranſcendent Excellencies (as they ſparkle forth from the creatures) to effect the neereſt, moſt intire Union of likeneſs that is poſſible, between himſelf and every ſuch Sinner that ſhall em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Goſpel Diſcoveries. The Lord ſtands enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by this, to make every ſuch Soul a Partaker of his own ſpotleſs Purity, and Holineſs, yea to make it Participate of his Divine Nature, of his own life, ſo as the ſame life that dwells in himſelf, and that
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:48673:170"/>
himſelf lives by, ſhould alſo dwell in every ſuch Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soul embracing thoſe Goſpel Diſcoveries. Nay the Engagement is ſo Invincible, that if the Lord ſhould not Communicate the higheſt degree of his Communicable Perfection to every ſuch Loveleſs Forlorn Sinner, as ſhall and will embrace Goſpel Diſcoveries, he ſhould bereave himſelf of that ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Pleaſure and Contentment, that his Soul takes in the Contemplation of the Beams of his own Glory, ſeeing every ſuch Soul is the choſen object, in whom the Lord determins from eternity to delight himſelf, by the ſparkling forth of his own Glory through it.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. A ſixth Engagement that God hath laid upon himſelf to fulfil Goſpel Diſcoveries is this, That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very unlovely Sinner that ſhall embrace them is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from Eternity by the Lords infinite Wiſdom, to be an Orient bright ſhining Pearl in the all beautiful Crown of the Lords accidental Glory. Miſtake me not, the mighty Sun of the Lords infinite eſſential Glory, cannot admit either of Augmentation or Diminution, I mean, either of Leſſening or Increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing its Tranſcendent Brightneſs: But the Lords acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Glory, that is to ſay, the manifeſtation and Diſcovery of thoſe precious Beams of his eſſential Glory, may and do admit of Eclipſes and Overſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowings, and alſo of an increaſe and augmentation in their Brightneſs and Excellency. Now every Forlorn Soul that ſhall embrace Goſpel Diſcoveries, is laid as it were as a precious Golden Thred, in that rich Broidered Robe of that Glory, that the King of Heaven Cloaths himſelf with, to make himſelf Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the eyes of Saints and Angels. This is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſted in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.6, 7, if you compare it with
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:48673:170"/>
                  <hi>John</hi> 1.12, <hi>Bring forth my Sons and Daughters,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>whom I have Created for my Glory;</hi> Now they are only thoſe that receive the Lord Jeſus tendred in the Goſpel; <hi>To as many as received him, even to them that believe in him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God.</hi> And hence you ſhall obſerve, that the people of God are not only ſaid to be Created for his Glory, but they are called <hi>his glory, Iſa.</hi> 46.13. Nay more, they are called <hi>the Crown of the Lords Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Iſa.</hi> 62.3. Nay further the Lord looks upon them as his <hi>Ornament, Ezek.</hi> 7.10. And hence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they are called <hi>the Portion of God, Jer.</hi> 12.10. Yea hence the Scripture declares the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>to ſhine as the Stars in the Firmament, Dan.</hi> 12.3. In regard they ſhall be very Bright Shining Pearls that ſhall ſtand in the Crown of the Lords Honour. Now there are three reſpects, wherein every ſuch Unlovely Sinner embracing Goſpel Diſcoveries is one of the ſet Pearls that ſhine forth in the Crown of the Lords Glory.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard the All beautiful Unparalleld Crown of the ſuper added Honour of the Lord Jeſus, is Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of all thoſe Souls that ſhall embrace thoſe Goſpel Diſcoveries. Thence it is, that ſuch Goſpel Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are called <hi>the Glory of Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.23. And thence it is that the Church (which is the Company of thoſe) is called <hi>the fulneſs of Chriſt. Eph.</hi> 1.23. Now the Honour of Jeſus Chriſt, through the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Unity between the Father and the Son, is alſo the Fathers Honour; and ſo conſequently every ſuch Soul being one of thoſe Beautiful Flowers in the Garland of Chriſts Honour, he becomes alſo one of thoſe rich Diamonds wherewith the Crown of the Fathers Glory is richly beſet. According to that in
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:48673:171"/>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22, 23. where the whole Glory that Jeſus Chriſt attains as he is Mediatour, is revealed to be Terminated and ended in the Fathers Glory. <hi>[All is yours]</hi> That is, all things are finally for your ſakes; Or rather all things have a natural tendency through the Everlaſting Decree of God, unto your good. And <hi>[ye are Chriſts]</hi> That is, and all you by vertue of the ſame Decree, have a natural tendency to all the good you attain unto, the good of Jeſus Chriſt: All the Glory that is put upon you, hath a natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency unto the Glory of Jeſus Chriſt, to make up the perfection of his Glory. And then obſerve, and ſaith he <hi>[Chriſt is Gods]</hi> That is, all the Good, the Glory, the Honour that Jeſus Chriſt attains, through his being the Center wherein all your good meets all that meets in the Father; that is all his Honour tends only to the exalting of the Fathers Honour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard the brighteſt Beams of the Fathers eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Glory are manifeſt in every ſuch Soul. The Lord from before the Foundations of the World were laid, made choice of thoſe Souls to be as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtal Glaſſes, through which the Beams of his Incomprehenſible Eſſential Glory ſhould ſhine forth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In every ſuch Soul is manifeſt, the infinite Unſearchable depths of the Fathers Divine Wiſdom. The manner of the Fathers Diſpoſing of thoſe ſouls, to ſuffer them by the free working of their own Wills to loſe themſelves, and bring themſelves under the Power of everlaſting Wrath and Indignation, and then his Wiſdom in contriving a way to ſave the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his own Juſtice, and the Redemption of thoſe Poor, Loſt, Periſhing Souls, ſo wonderfully, to make the Honour of Mercy and Love and Juſtice to
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:48673:171"/>
meet together in one, to make Mercy and Juſtice kiſs each other, is that which will be the matter of Admiration to all thoſe Inhabitants of the Sacred Palace of Heaven to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Brighteſt Beams of his unſpeakable, unconceivable love appear, and are manifeſted to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuch Soul. The higheſt perfection of Love that ever the Lord manifeſted, is in Loving ſuch Unlovely, Forlorn, Loathſome Souls as theſe, and that alſo while he Rejected and Diſregarded Creatures far more Glorious according to their firſt Creation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Almighty Power of the Lord is alſo Gloriouſly manifeſted in every ſuch Soul, in that he ſhould create anew thoſe Loveleſs Sinners that were oppoſite to their own new Creation, I mean their own Regeneration. Therein indeed did Power appear, in that the Lord did raiſe the Soul from the loweſt degree of Enmity, into the neereſt Union with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that againſt all the Oppoſitions that Hell can make, and againſt all the Powers of the Soul it ſelf, when both concur together againſt God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Glorious Independency of the Lords Will, in all the Motions and Operations of it, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted abundantly in every ſuch ſoul. The Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Lord in all his ways, doth not ſhine forth ſo clearly in any of the Works of God, as in that Pretious Myſtery of his Election, in making of the ſame lump one Veſſel to Honour, and another to Diſhonour, there being no Engagements, no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to incline his Pretious Will either this way or that way.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Every ſuch Soul is a ſet ſhining Diamond in the Crown of the Lords Honour, In regard it is deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Eternity, to ſtand as a conſtant clear Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:48673:172"/>
Glaſs, through which the Lord would manifeſt the Tranſcendency of his own perfection unto all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And it is through thoſe Communications of the Father unto the Soul, that the Fathers Glory is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and thence it is that the Brightneſs of the Fathers Glory ſhall be ſhining forth Reſplendently unto all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity in every ſuch Soul. Now we are to conſider what full ſecurity the Spirit may give from hence to every ſuch Soul, concerning the Infallible fulfilling of all Goſpel Diſcoveries to the utmoſt, into its Boſom that ſhall embrace them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From thence the Spirit may reveal to the Soul, that the Lord ſtands engaged by the Inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Diſpoſition of his own nature, (which natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tends to his own Glory) to Compleat and Perfect an Union between the Lord Jeſus, and every Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Sinner that ſhall embrace Goſpel Diſcoveries. The Crown of the Fathers Glory being but the Iſſue and Reſult of the Glory of the Lord Jeſus, and then the Glory of Chriſt having its full and ſole Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the compleat Union of all thoſe with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that ſhall embrace the Goſpel, thence the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtands engaged to Perfect and Compleat that U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion between Chriſt and all thoſe Souls, ſeeing his natural Diſpoſition doth neceſſarily incline him, to be compleating the Crown of his own Glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſpirit may reveal to the Soul, that the Lord ſtands engaged by the property of his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Nature, to Love Compleatly and Perfectly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Goſpel Embracer, without the leaſt Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon any thing in the Soul, or any thing to be done by the Soul. Now what abundant ſecurity may every Soul, Trembling and Fearing leaſt the Lord
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:48673:172"/>
ſhould not be willing to accept it into Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with himſelf, receive from hence againſt all his fears!</p>
               <p n="3">3. From this conſideration the Lord ſtands enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, by all his tender reſpects to the bright Shining Splendor of his own Imperial Crown to Beautify and Adorn every Forlorn Sinner Embracing Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Diſcoveries, with the moſt Gliſtering Beams of his own Matchleſs Perfection, that can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by any Finite Creature. Now Goſpel Embraces being choſen by the Lord from Eternity, to be the precious matter whereof he will Compoſe that his everlaſting Crown of Glory, whereby his Honour and Majeſty ſhould Glitter forth before the eyes of Saints and Angels, brighter than ten Thouſand Suns in their Strength; Thence if every Goſpel Embracer ſhall not be Beautified and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the moſt Sparkling touch of Perfection that they are Capable of, the Bleſſed Majeſty of Heaven ſhould become negligent of Dignifying himſelf with the Brightneſs of Majeſty and Honour, through the Tranſparent Brightneſs of his Imperial Crown of Glory. And therefore according to this,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Scripture reveals, that the Celeſtial Glory and Surpaſſing Excellency, wherewith every Goſpel Embracer ſhall be Adorned and Beautified, doth Tranſcend and go beyond all Comprehenſion of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Brains and Created Underſtandings: According to that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither hath it entred into the Heart of Man, the things which God hath prepared for thoſe that love him:</hi> Mark what the Apoſtle affirms; He affirms that the Sublime Myſterious Workings of Heavenly Wiſdom about Goſpel Embracers, was never Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:48673:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet with any finite brain by any mortal heart: and O how infinitely unconceivable then are the workings of that heavenly wiſdom in themſelves! Alas what the Goſpel reveals of them, is but like a ſmall reflection of the Sun beams to the Sun it ſelf, It is but a ſmall grain to a golden Mine, it is but a drop of the bucket to the great Ocean: O then how great an exaltation of ſuch unlovely Sinners to moſt ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative perfection and unconceivable glory, muſt needs be the effect of ſuch a depth of heavenly divine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom being imployed about them from eternity! This depth of the myſtery of divine wiſdom about Goſpel embracers was never fathomed by Angelical Underſtandings, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. <hi>which things the Angels deſire to look into,</hi> ſaith the Original <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Into which things the Angels earneſtly with all their ſtrength and intention of mind deſire to look into: The word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies ſuch a looking into things, as to ſtoop down with the head, and bow down with the body, that it might be the thing it looks upon to diſcern it fully. It is the ſame word the Apoſtle uſeth, <hi>John</hi> 20.11. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> ſhe ſtooped down and look<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked into the Sepulchre, that ſhe might ſee narrowly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the thing.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The Scripture reveals more particularly, that moſt unconceivable perfection, moſt celeſtial glory, ſhall be put upon the perſons of Goſpel-embracers in every part, power and faculty that belongs to them.</p>
               <p n="1">I. According to this Engagement of God, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves that the very bodies of Goſpel-embracers ſhall be beautified, and indued with moſt tranſcendent, bright, ſhining glory, with almoſt incomparable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. That one Scripture is enough to clear it out,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:48673:173"/>
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. <hi>He ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body.</hi> O how did the quinteſſence of all perfection meet together in the glorious body of Chriſt! You may remember in the Transfiguration of Chriſt, which was but a glimpſe of his beauty and glory, the hearts of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were amazed, their Souls were raviſhed to behold it, they were tranſported beyond themſelves, and began to cry out, <hi>let us make Tabernacles,</hi> Let us dwell here to behold this Glory for ever: But how much more tranſcendently excellent is the Glory of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, now he is exalted to all Glory! And yet the Bodies of Goſpel Embracers muſt be like his Glorious Body.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All Privative Perfection ſhall be put upon them. An everlaſting Exemption and perfect Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from all Defects and Imperfections, all Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Deformities, all Pains, Perplexities, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtries, ſo as there ſhall be no neceſſity of the Aid and Aſſiſtance of their fellow Creatures, to ſupport and uphold, to relieve and Refreſh them as there is here below, but their <hi>Bodies ſhall be like Angels. Mat.</hi> 22.30.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Scripture reveals that there ſhall be moſt admirable Poſitive Perfection put upon them; Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality it ſelf: their lives ſhall be extended to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, equal with the Life of the eternal God, they ſhall run Parallel with the Life of God in the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt lines of Eternity. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54. <hi>This mortal ſhall put on immortality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They ſhall be indued with Incorruptibleneſs. They ſhall in a manner be made impaſſive, not being made capable of any paſſion, by any corrupt quality. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.42. <hi>It is Sown in Corruption, it is Raiſed in Incorruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:48673:174"/>4. They ſhall be indued with almoſt Incredible Angelical Power, Potency, Might and Strength. They ſhall be made every way ſutable to the deſire of the Souls themſelves, and made ſutable for he Soul to act in the higheſt way, in the moſt Sublime way of Operation, without Wearineſs, without Interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without Intermiſſion, They ſhall be able to bear the infinite weight of Glory, the leaſt drop whereof they are not able to bear for the preſent.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The body ſhall be indued with moſt excellent ſpirituality. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.44. <hi>It is Sown a Natural Body, it is Raiſed a Spiritual Body:</hi> They ſhall not be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into ſpirits, but the Body ſhall be made ſo ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, through the fulneſs of the ſpirit in it, that it ſhall be as ready to the Bleſſed Will of God in every thing, as the ſoul it ſelf that ſhall be purely Holy: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it ſhall have a Wonderful Nimbleneſs, and Agili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Activeneſs, to be able at the ſouls deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, to move hither or thither with moſt Incredible ſpeed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Scripture reveals, the very Perfection and Quinteſſence of Beauty it ſelf, ſhall be put upon the Vileſt of the Bodies of the Goſpel Embracers. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.43. <hi>It is Sown in Diſhonour, it is Raiſed in Glory, it is Sown in Weakneſs, it is Raiſed in Power:</hi> There ſhall be the exacteſt Form and Feature, the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Comlineſs and ſweet Proportion, a moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Congruent Symmetry of all the parts, there ſhall be the ſweeteſt pleaſing mixture of the loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Colour of Red and White, there ſhall be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual actuating to the Life both theſe Colours and Parts, ſo as they ſhall be Preſerved in a perpetual Orient Freſhneſs; yea the Materials of Beauty, through the Unſpeakable Chearfulneſs of the Heart
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:48673:174"/>
within, and through the admirable excellency that the Soul ſhall be raiſed to, ſhall be ſo actuated to the very Life, that the very Beauty of the Body ſhall Sparkle and Glitter, as Bright as the Brighteſt Gliſtering Beam of the Sun in the Firmament, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Scripture reveals the higheſt perfection to be put upon their Souls. It were a work infinite and endleſs to ſearch into the various, glorious excellency and faculties, wherewith every Soul embracing Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Diſcoveries ſhall be endued: Our capacities are narrow here concerning the Soul, we know little of it and of its Original, yet thus much we may affirm of it from the Scripture, that every faculty of the Soul ſhall be adorned with the moſt ſuitable perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and excellency that it is capable of: The under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhall be extraordinarily and ſupernaturally irradiated with the higheſt illumination, the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt comprehenſion: The Will ſhall be extended to the moſt perfect operation towards God himſelf, all the motions of it working in their perfection termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively upon God alone, which indeed is the very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of holineſs: So as the height of the Souls per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſhall be every way anſwerable, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the ſuperexcellent glory, wherewith their bodies ſhall be indued and adorned.</p>
               <p n="3">III. From what the Scripture reveals concerning the beautifying the body with ſuch high perfections, and the beautifying of the Soul alſo, I may add a word by conſequence: That a moſt admirable, unſpeakable glory, ſhall appear in the perſons of thoſe Goſpel-embracers, when a body filled with ſuch perfection, and a ſoul raiſed in a manner infinitely higher, ſhall be united into one, to make up one perſon: O what
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:48673:175"/>
Honour and Majeſty will ſhine from the very counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of ſuch a Perſon! When <hi>Stephen</hi> ſtood before the Face of the Councel, through a ſweet Viſion of Heaven opened, his Countenance appeared like the Face of an Angel: But O what Beams of Majeſty, Honour, Beauty, and Glory, will Glitter from the Perſons of Goſpel Embracers, when they ſhall be Inhabitants in the Palace of Heaven it ſelf! Now all this admirable Perfection, wherewith every Sinner Embracing Goſpel Diſcoveries ſhall thus be Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is but the Effect and Conſequence of the Preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Eternal Determination of God, to make eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Unlovely Sinner Embracing Goſpel Diſcoveries, to be as one of the Diamonds that ſhould ſtand to glitter in the Crown of his own Glory.</p>
               <p n="7">7. There is a Seventh Ingagement, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit alſo may reveal the Lord to have laid upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in reſpect of himſelf, to fulfill all Goſpel-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries into the boſom of every unlovely Sinner that ſhall embrace him, and that is this; every ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovely ſinner, that ſhall and will accept the Goſpel-Diſcovery, is choſen from Eternity to be a Royal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant of the Sacred Palace of the Empyrean Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, there to attend the Majeſty of Heaven perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, to behold the Brightneſs of his Glory and Majeſty. When the Lord who from Eternity ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only in himſelf, did pleaſe from the Motions of his own Will alone to create a World, to be a goodly Theatre wherein he would manifeſt his Power, Bounty, Goodneſs, and Love, then did that Bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Majeſty pleaſe to Compoſe on purpoſe that Vaſt Empyrean Heaven, and to Beautify, and Adorn it with the moſt Exquiſite Excellency, and Tranſcendent Glory, to make it ſhine with the Brighteſt Beams of
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:48673:175"/>
Majeſty and Glory, that it might be a Sacred Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace for himſelf, wherein he reſolves to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himſelf moſt Beatifically, to the Nobleſt Creatures, Elect Saints and Angels, and wherein he purpoſeth to diſcover the moſt Tranſparent Beams of his unſpeakable Majeſty and Glory that ever Creature ſhould behold: Now in like manner the Lord alſo determined, that every of the Souls of Mankind, (whom he foreſaw ſhould fall into a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing loſt condition) accepting union and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with himſelf, ſhould be one of his Houſhould Servants, admitted into his Bleſſed Preſence-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in whom he would delight himſelf, by Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Incomprehenſible Glory. Hence it is that you ſhall find in Scripture, that the <hi>Kingdom</hi> is ſaid to be given to thoſe Goſpel Embracers. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.32. And hence it is that the Saints are ſaid to have <hi>an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance Incorruptible, that Fadeth not away,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3, 4. And hence it is alſo that every Goſpel Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer is ſaid to be an <hi>Heir of Heaven, Rom.</hi> 8.17, And <hi>Heirs of a Kingdom. Jam.</hi> 2.5. All theſe Scriptures Compared together, abundantly evidence, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſuch Goſpel Embracer, is choſen to be a Royal Inhabitant of the Sacred Palace of the Empyrean Heaven. Now that they are choſen to dwell there on purpoſe, that they might attend, and behold the Beauty of his own Majeſty and Glory, this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly evidenced from many Scriptures; Chriſt himſelf ſpeaks it in <hi>John</hi> 17.24. <hi>Father I will that they whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my Glory which thou haſt given me.</hi> Now the Glory of Jeſus Chriſt is ſo Interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with the Glory of the Father, that they cannot be the Beholders of the Glory of Chriſt, except they
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:48673:176"/>
be alſo Beholders of the Glory of God the Father. And again in that 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8. <hi>Now we are the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be, but we know that when he appears, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> So that from theſe Scriptures joyntly conſidered, we may conclude,</p>
               <p n="1">I. That every Goſpel Embracer is choſen, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Brightneſs of his Majeſty and Glory, by beholding the Divine Eſſence it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He is choſen to behold the Bleſſed ſweet Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and Indiviſible Unity of the Godhead. To diſcern the Lord, and to ſee him to be as one moſt Pure Simple Act.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Every Goſpel Embracer is choſen to behold the Sacred, and Secret Myſtery of the Holy Trinity. To behold that one Indiviſible Eſſence of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in three manner of ways; To ſee three Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtences and but the ſame Eſſence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Every ſuch Soul is choſen to behold the Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of the Divine Eſſence. They are choſen to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a Tranſcendency of all Imaginable Perfection that ever their eyes beheld, to be Compriſed in that one Divine Eſſence with abſolute Perfection.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They are choſen to behold the Divine Eſſence, in all its moſt Glorious Operations. They are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to be admitted into the Preſence-Chamber of the Divine Majeſty, ſo as to behold all the Records of Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Every ſuch Soul is choſen perpetually to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Brightneſs of his Majeſty and Glory, in Beholding the Glory of Jeſus Chriſt as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:48673:176"/>1. They are choſen to behold the admirable My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, of the Union of the Divine Perſon to the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature. That which is now an Inexplicable Myſtery to the Believers Eye, ſhall then by Gods chooſing them to behold his Glory, be Diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is choſen to behold all the bright Beams of Glory, that appear in the Myſtical Union of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Loſt, Rebellious, Sinking, Periſhing Souls, to the Lord as to one Head.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Every ſuch Soul is choſen to behold the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Perfection of the Secret Love of the Lord Jeſus, to ſuch Unlovely Sinners, while they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together Loveleſs, while they were altogether Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, matter of Loathing to his pure Eyes.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Every ſuch Soul is choſen from Eternity, to attend upon the Royal Majeſty of Heaven in his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Palace, that they may behold his Glory in the Brighteſt manner.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He is choſen to behold thoſe bright Beams of Majeſty and Glory, in a poſitive way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is choſen to behold the Beams of his Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Majeſty and Glory in an immediate way. There will be no need of Speeches to Repreſent the Lord to our Underſtandings, as there is now.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is choſe to behold the Brightneſs of the Lords Majeſty and Glory, in a Simple Pure way. Not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively, or by Relations, as Goſpel Embracers for preſent behold the Light of the Lords Glory: As when we conceive of the Glory of the Majeſty of Heaven, we conceive of him as the moſt abſolute Monarch of Heaven and Earth, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; This is but Relation, but
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:48673:177"/>
we ſhall then ſee the Lord in a ſutable way, even as he is.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is choſen to behold them fully. Not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Reflection only, but the Sun it ſelf of Glory.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is choſen to behold them everlaſtingly. Hence the Soul may diſcern God to be engaged, by his higheſt Relation of his own Eternal Contentment, to perfect both Union and Communion, between him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and every Unlovely Sinner, that ſhall and will accept Goſpel Diſcoveries, ſeeing every ſuch Soul as ſhall accept Goſpel Diſcoveries, is Deſigned by himſelf from Eternity, to be one of his Royal Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants in his Sacred Palace, that ſhould behold the Brightneſs of his Majeſty and Glory.</p>
               <p>Now before I can paſs from this ſecond work of the Spirit upon Souls; There are Five or Six things that every Soul of us muſt remember, leaſt we mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand the manner of the Spirits irradiating the Goſpel unto Souls.</p>
               <p n="1">I. We muſt obſerve, That the Spirit of the Lord doth in a different manner, cauſe theſe Glorious Beams of Divine light, to ſhine forth from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe into dark Souls. The Spirit in this Bleſſed work of Irradiation of the Goſpel unto dark Souls, doth to ſome reveal only ſome of thoſe Pretious Soul Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing Beams of Light, that you have heard opened; To others he cauſeth more abundance of thoſe Preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Beams of Light, to ſhine into the heart: And from hence, various Souls have various Degrees of this aſſurance of Faith, and various Degrees of Joy and Peace ſlowing forth from that aſſurance of Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:48673:177"/>II. You muſt alſo obſerve concerning this work of Irradiation of the Goſpel, That the Spirit doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt thoſe Beams of Divine Light from the Goſpel, in different Degrees of Clearneſs unto Souls.</p>
               <p n="3">III. You muſt alſo obſerve, that the Lord doth in a different degree continue the manifeſtation, and Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiation of the Promiſe or of the Goſpel unto diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſouls. I ſpeak ſtill of thoſe ſouls that do receive through the ſpirits Irradiation of the Goſpel, ſome aſſurance unto their Faith of their union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. You muſt alſo underſtand, that the ſpirit doth reveal the ſubſtance of all this Heavenly Light, the Sum and Compendium of all that you have heard, and cauſe it to ſhine into ſouls from the promiſe. This the ſpirit doth cauſe to ſhine into every ſoul, that attains unto any degree of aſſurance of Faith: Though the ſpirit works variouſly, in regard of the clearneſs of revealing what it doth reveal, and variouſly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the time and continuance of its manifeſtation of that Heavenly Light unto ſouls, yet thoſe preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Beams of Heavenly Light, that the ſpirit cauſeth to Glitter forth from the promiſes unto ſouls, are of neceſſity to be revealed unto every ſoul that attains unto any aſſurance of Faith.</p>
               <p n="5">V. We muſt obſerve, that the ſpirit of the Lord doth out of his own infinite Wiſdom, ſelect the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular truth of the Goſpel, whereby he will aſſure any particular ſoul of his union with Chriſt. Though thoſe particular Beams of Divine Light mentioned, be in the ſubſtance revealed to the Faith of every ſoul to whom the ſpirit gives union, yet the particular wherein the ſpirit makes the Brightneſs, the Glory, the Luſtre, the ſatisfying and Over-powering Glory
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:48673:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of thoſe Beams of light to appear to the ſouls eye, theſe are ſelected by the Wiſdom of the ſpirit it ſelf, though it is but the ſubſtance alſo, or the effect of thoſe particulars, whereby we have revealed thoſe Beams of Divine Light to you.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. You muſt obſerve, that the ſpirit doth reveal or manifeſt, all the bright ſhining of Divine Light from the promiſe, at one and the ſame moment to the ſoul, when it draws forth the ſouls Faith unto acts of aſſurance. The ſpirit may be Inſtructing the dark ſoul many Years, in the Pretious Myſtery of the Goſpel of Chriſt, before it raiſeth the ſouls Faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to aſſuring acts, and may be increaſing the ſtrength of the ſouls confidence gradually, in every Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in all thoſe years; But yet wherever the ſpirit draws out the God believing Diſpoſitions, that it hath infuſed into any ſouls, to act by way of fulneſs of confidence, then the ſpirit preſents all this Preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Light of the Goſpel at once, and gives the ſoul one Glorious view of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly the ſpirit of the Lord proceeds from Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the ſoul, and Irradiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel to the ſoul, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.<note place="margin">The Spirits Conviction of the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> From the Powerful Efficacy of that Divine light, infuſed into the underſtanding, and the Precious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the ſweeteſt light of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the Goſpel unto the Light Inherent, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth a Powerful Inward Conviction of the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: According to that in <hi>John</hi> 16.9, 10. <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhall reprove, and convince the World of Sin, of Righteouſneſs, and of Judgment:</hi> It ſhall <hi>[Convince the World of Righteouſneſs,]</hi> that is, of free Juſtification of Deſpicable, Forlorn, Guilty Sinners, through
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:48673:178"/>
the Lord Jeſus alone. This Conviction of the ſoul or of the Conſcience, it is a clear Unqueſtionable, and Infallible Demonſtration, given by the ſpirit to the doubtful ſoul, of the Lords Will, that even that his particular Forlorn, Worthleſs, Stubborn ſoul, ſhall be received into the neareſt union with himſelf in Chriſt. Or rather it is a Commanding Power of the Spirit of God, exerciſed upon the ſoul, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it conſtrains it to receive that clear Infallible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that the Bleſſed Word of God gives of the Lords Will to receive his Stubborn, Rebellious, Unworthy Soul, into union with the Lord Jeſus. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by the Spirits Illumination, and the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel to the Soul, there is a moſt Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Demonſtration given, of the Lords Will to accept any one particular ſoul to be one with him, if he will accept him: but in the Work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction is moſt properly the Mighty Overpowring work of the ſpirit upon the Mind and Conſcience, conſtraining it to receive the Demonſtration. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction is properly the ſilencing all Cavils, Doubts, of Contradictions of the mind, againſt any truth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and a making of it undenyable to it, that it dare not make any objection, or raiſe any one Cavil more, to what the Lord propounded to his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Loveleſs ſoul, but to ſit down ſatisfied, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the truth of what the Lord propounded to him, to confeſs that it is the Will of the Bleſſed God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that it ſhould be one with himſelf in the Lord Jeſus, and enjoy everlaſting Communion with him. There is a neceſſity of the Spirits thus convincing the Soul, beſides its Illumination and its Irradirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel to it, and that in two reſpects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:48673:179"/>Firſt in reſpect of the Mind, or Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>And Secondly in reſpect of the Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In reſpect of the mind. The Power of Corruption hath ſo Captivated the Mind and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that both the Illumination of it, and Irradia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel unto the mind would be Ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, ſhould not the ſpirit ſtrike in to make up the ſouls Conviction. There is a four fold Diſpoſition in the Mind, that doth cauſe a kind of neceſſity of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the ſpirit, beſides the Irradiation of the Goſpel to the Mind.</p>
               <p n="1">I. There is a Wretched Unteachableneſs, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally poſſeſſeth all our Minds. There is not only Darkneſs poſſeſſing the mind, but an oppoſition againſt the receiving Light. Now in reſpect of this Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our minds naturally, we are unapt to receive any thing the ſpirit reveals, ſhould there not be a further Power and Efficacy of the ſpirit upon the Heart.</p>
               <p n="2">II. There is a moſt Superlative incredulity that remains in our minds. <hi>The God of the World hath blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the mind.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4, not by a privative extincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Light infuſed (that is beyond the Devils Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) but by a poſitive darkneſs, a poſitive Ignorance, by perſwading the minds of all to believe other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ſuch as contradict thoſe bleſſed Principles of Divine Truth. Now in reſpect of this Incredulity that poſſeſſes our Minds, there is a neceſſity that the Spirit ſhould have a further work upon the ſoul than bare Illumination, and Manifeſtation of the Goſpel to the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:48673:179"/>III. There is an Indiſpoſition in our Minds, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing that they cannot Comprehend. Now all the Glorious Diſcoveries in that Myſtery of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt being Incomprehenſible, thence the mind would receive none of thoſe Preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Diſcoveries, though the Spirit did Irradiate the Goſpel of the Lord Jeſus to it, if another Mighty Power of the Spirit ſhould not come in upon the Heart, to Convince the Soul of it.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. There is an abſolute Enmity in the mind againſt thoſe Divine Truths. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. The Carnal Mind is Enmity againſt God. Now this Curſed Enmity dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Unregenerate part, makes its conſtant Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition with all its Power and Strength, againſt all that the Spirit reveals; And ſo all the Pretious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of the Goſpel of the Lord Jeſus to the Mind would be ineffectual, ſhould not another Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Power of the Spirit come in to Conquer the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Enmity, and to Conſtrain the Soul to receive thoſe Demonſtrations of the Will of God, to receive the Loveleſs Soul into union with himſelf as a thing undenyable.</p>
               <p>Secondly there is a neceſſity of it in regard of the Conſcience alſo.</p>
               <p>The Conſcience is a Regiſter, Might and Power, placed by the Lord in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,<note place="margin">What Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is.</note> to record all the Motions of the whole Man, and to Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Equity or Iniquity of them, and to determine of them either with the Soul, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Soul. Now the Conſcience is alſo ſo Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, that there is a neceſſity of this Conviction of the Spirit, beſides this Illumination and Irradiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>for the mind and Conſcience is defiled,</hi> Titus 1.15.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:48673:180"/>Now there are two that are the moſt eminent Works of Conſcience.</p>
               <p n="1">I. To Diſcover the Equity or Iniquity of any thing Propounded to the Soul to be done, or of any thing that is done by the Soul. Now in this the Conſcience is dreadfully Corrupt, here the Conſcience calls Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity Equity, and Equity Iniquity, calls Good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and Evil Good, naturally in a great meaſure. Now thence there is neceſſity of this Conviction of the Spirit alſo, in regard the Conſcience will never determine that it is good for the Soul, to receive thoſe Pretious Diſcoveries of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt to it, unleſs the Spirit Overpowers the Corrupted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and Convince it of the Equity of receiving it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond act of Conſcience is, to determine of any thing that is already done by the Soul. Its work is to Accuſe, and Excuſe the Soul, both in its doing of things, and after the doing of them. Now Conſcience is ſo dreadfully Corrupt naturally, that like a Corrupt Judge, or a Bribed Judge, it accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth when it ſhould Excuſe, and Excuſeth when it ſhould Accuſe, it Frees the Guilty, and Condemns the Innocent. Now in reſpect of this Corruption of the Conſcience, though the Spirit of the Lord doth Illuminate the Soul in part (for its never higher) and then preſent the Goſpel to the Enlightned Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and gives clear Manifeſtations of the Lords Will, to admit the Soul into Union with himſelf in Chriſt; yet the Corrupt Conſcience will never deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine with the ſoul, to Excuſe the Soul in receiving thoſe Pretious Diſcoveries of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt to it, but would and will perpetually Accuſe the Soul as a Preſumptuous Wretch, unleſs the Spirit
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:48673:180"/>
of God ſhould exerciſe this Convincing Power upon the Conſcience, even after the work of the Irradiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel to the Soul. So that this work of the Spirit in Conviction, draws clear unqueſtionable Demonſtrations for the ſoul from the Goſpel, to prove that it is an Infallible certainty, that it is the Lords Will to accept that Particular Deſpicable, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn Sinner to be one with him; and it conſiſts alſo in the Commanding Power of the Spirit of God upon the Determination, whereby it ſilenceth all Cavillings of the Soul, and puts a Holy Conſtraint upon the Mind and Conſcience, to receive that Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as True and Undenyable: So that the Spirit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him to confeſs with his own Mouth, that it is the Will of the Bleſſed God, that even this my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn, Loathſome, Deſpicable, Unlovely Soul, ſhould be one with himſelf for ever. This is the Spirits Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, which is the third work of the Spirit upon the Soul, towards the drawing forth its Faith by way of aſſurance, or by which the Spirit doth proceed, to give the Soul a full aſſurance of his Union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There is a fourth effect of the Spirit of God upon Hearts, for revealing to them their Union with Chriſt Certainly and Infallibly,<note place="margin">The Spirits Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation.</note> ſo as to give the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and that is the Spirits Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation of the Habits of Grace formerly Infuſed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their proper and peculiar Exerciſe. Now here you muſt obſerve, the Spirit doth not Quicken, Inli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Actuate all kind of Gratious Diſpoſitions Infuſed into the Sanctified Soul, in any immediate Revelation; aſſuring its Faith of his Acceptance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Union with the Lord; For indeed the Souls aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:48673:181"/>
unto Faith, doth not properly ariſe from any of the actings of thoſe Holy Diſpoſitions that are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into it, but proceed only from the right Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the good Will of the Lord in Chriſt unto Loveleſs Sinners: For indeed the Spirit in this work of Excitation, as it ſtands in Relation to the aſſuring the Soul through Believing, of his Union with Chriſt, hath only and peculiarly, the Believing Diſpoſition that was Infuſed into the Soul, at Chriſts firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the Soul, for its proper Object, and as Exerciſing Influences chiefly flow down from that believing Diſpoſition: Now the Spirits Excitation of the Believing Diſpoſition, doth neceſſarily follow the three former effects of the Spirit upon Hearts, in regard all theſe effects of the Spirit upon the heart, are but preparative to this fourth effect, for indeed it is this fourth effect, which is the Spirits drawing forth Believing Diſpoſitions into act, which is the Formality of Aſſurance, or Aſſurance it ſelf: The other only are abſolutely neceſſary Preparatives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the aſſurance, they are Preparations indeed both Privatively and Poſitively; But they are but Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Theſe three acts of the Spirit are Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons privatively, by preventing all Impediments and Obſtructions, that hinder the Soul from acting Faith by way of aſſurance.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The firſt work of the Spirit which is its Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that doth privatively prepare the Soul for the aſſuring act of Faith,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By preventing the Soul from bottoming its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence upon the Sands. Before the Bleſſed work of Illumination, ſouls miſtake the right Bottom of their Confidence of the Lords accepting them into
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:48673:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Union with Chriſt, and ſo conſequently caſt out the Anchor of their Souls, upon the ground of their own Humiliation for Sin; another time upon the Quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Enlargings of their Hearts, through the Sanctifying Spirit, and ſo Conſequently never enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the leaſt Confidence of the Lords accepting of them into Union with Chriſt, any further then they can diſcern thoſe Quickning Enlargeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Inlivenings of that Sanctifying Spirit in their Hearts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That doth prepare privatively for the aſſurance, by Preventing the Soul from ſeeking in a falſe manner after the attaining of Confidence upon a true bottom. Before the Spirits full Illumination, the Soul com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly miſtakes, about the manner of caſting out an Anchor of Confidence upon that true ground, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving there is no right manner of any Souls caſting himſelf with Confidence upon the Lord, unleſs the Soul doth firſt diſcern himſelf to be a Beleiver.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond work alſo of the Spirits Irradiation of the Goſpel unto Souls, is to prepare privatively for the aſſuring of the Souls Faith of his Union with Chriſt. Through the Spirits Irradiation, all Miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions about the Tender of Union with Chriſt with the Soul are removed.</p>
               <p n="3">III. By the Spirits Conviction the Soul is prepared Privatively, for the aſſuring his Faith of his union, and that three ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By removing of the Contrariety of the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that poſſeſſeſs the Soul. Before the Spirits Irradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Goſpel in ſome Degree, and Conviction of the Conſcience by that Irradiation, the Heart is haled hither and thither, by an Apprehenſion of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning that always dwells within him: The Heart ſometimes Inclining to a Dreadful Concluſion, that
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:48673:182"/>
the Lord will never accept of his Forlorn Soul into Union with the Lord Jeſus: Another time again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to believe, that the Lord is willing to accept even his Soul into Union with Chriſt: Now by the Irradiation of the Goſpel to the Soul, and the ſpirits Conviction of the Conſcienee, the Contrariety of Reaſoning in the ſoul is removed; The Reaſons for accepting the ſoul into Union with the Lord Jeſus, bearing more weight with the ſpirit, than all the Objections and Contradictions that Hell, and the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Heart can make againſt it; So that the ſoul diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns more ground to imagine, that the Lord is willing to accept his ſoul into Union with Chriſt, than he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns ground to think the contrary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Through the ſpirits Conviction, the Uproar and Tumult in the ſouls Affections are Allayed and Help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Through the Contrariety of reaſoning in the ſoul, all the Affections are put into a Tumult and Rage: When one kind of reaſoning Prevails, then one kind of Affection works ſtrongly, and when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Reaſonings prevail, then contrary Affections work as highly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſpirits Conviction that is annexed to the ſpirits Manifeſtation of the Goſpel, doth prepare for the ſouls receiving aſſurance unto his Faith of his U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt by removing the Diſtraction that poſſeſſes the ſouls thoughts. As the Affections com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are in a Confuſion, ſo the thoughts alſo, the mind is conſtant in nothing elſe but unconſtancy, ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or fixing upon nothing. Now this being a great Impediment to the ſouls receiving aſſurance unto his Faith of his Union with Chriſt, the ſpirit priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to prepare the ſoul for it, removes this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="349" facs="tcp:48673:182"/>Secondly they are Preparations poſitively alſo.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The ſpirits work of Illumination, that doth prepare the ſubject for aſſurance. It is through that Illumination that the ſoul is diſpoſed into a poſſible condition, and a capable condition, to diſcern that everlaſting Rock of Ages, whereupon the Confidence of the ſouls union with Chriſt ſhall be caſt.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſpirits Irradiation, or Manifeſtation of the Goſpel, doth alſo prepare poſitively for the aſſuring the ſoul of his union with Chriſt, in regard that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the very matter of aſſurance. That Diſcovers the true ground, whereupon the ſoul may be Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of his Acceptance into union.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The third work of the ſpirit which is Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that prepares the ſoul for receiving the aſſurance unto his Faith of his union with Chriſt, by applying the matter of aſſurance particularly unto ſouls. It is the ſpirits manifeſtation of the Goſpel, that Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the ground whereupon ſouls may be confident of their acceptance into union with Chriſt; It is the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits Conviction, that makes particular application of that ground of Confidence. Thoſe three former works of the ſpirit are only Preparative unto aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the Formality of aſſurance is ſtill behind: Therefore the ſpirit comes with this fourth work, which is the Exciting and Stirring up this believing Diſpoſition into Exerciſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore now we muſt open to you what this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation of the Spirit is, and what the particular acts of the Spirit upon the ſoul are, that are Included un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this work of the ſpirits Excitation of the believing Diſpoſition unto its Operation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:48673:183"/>The Spirits Excitation is a Gracious, Free, Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Concurrence of the ſpirit, with the believing Manifeſtation,<note place="margin">What the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits Excitation is.</note> formerly Infuſed into the Soul. Or it is a Precious, Powerful influence of the ſpirit, upon the believing Diſpoſition. The Holy Diſpoſition that Inclines the Heart Habitually to believe, is as it were the Seed of aſſurance Sown in the Heart, but there muſt be the Concurrence of the Spirit with the Seed, or the Influence of the Spirit upon the Seed to make it Fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, ſo as there ſhall be an act of aſſuring Faith in the Soul. So that this Excitation of the Spirit, or the Spirits ſtirring up the believing Diſpoſition, is but a Continuance of that Holy Influence into the Soul, that was begun at the Souls firſt paſſive Union with the Lord Jeſus, whereby the Holy Diſpoſition that was then Infuſed, is Maintained, Preſerved, Increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, Actuated and Enlivened.</p>
               <p>Yet to open this more particularly.</p>
               <p n="1">I. I ſay it is a Gracious Concurrence of the Spirit with the believing Diſpoſition. I do not call it a Gracious Preſence of the Spirit, becauſe the Spirit takes up its Everlaſting Habitation in the Heart, at that paſſive Union between the Soul and Chriſt, that is, when it firſt Comprehends the Soul; and the Habitation of the Spirit may be ſaid to be equal at all times in the Soul, but its Conveyance of Grace into the Soul is not always equal.</p>
               <p n="2">II. This Excitation of the Spirit to the believing Diſpoſition, is a Gracious and Free Concurrence of the Spirit with the believing Diſpoſition. Free, not only as other Holy Motions of the Spirit in the Heart are free, which is in reſpect of their ſole Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:48673:183"/>
upon the free good Will of God to a Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Sinner; But it is a free Concurrence of the Spirit to the believing Diſpoſition, in regard of the Lords abſolute freedom that he Exerciſeth in Vouchſafing this unto Souls. That I may ſpeak the more clearly, you muſt conceive there is a Two-fold Influence of the Spirit into believing Souls. The firſt is an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary Influence: The other is a more Free Arbitrary Influence. The abſolute neceſſary Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is Two-fold.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That that's abſolutely neceſſary to Maintain the Life of a believing Soul.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That which is abſolutely neceſſary to Maintain the Growth of a believing Soul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Influence of the Spirit that is abſolutely neceſſary to Maintain the Life of the Believing Soul. Every Creature that hath any Life, hath ſome Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for that Life, which Maintenance being withdrawn, the Creatures Life would decay: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever do not miſtake me, every Living Creature muſt have ſome kind of Influence, from the firſt Being of Beings to maintain its Life: As the Angels have a more immediate Spiritual kind of Influence from God. Now that that the Wiſdom of the Lord hath Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, ſhould Maintain the Spiritual Life begotten in a believing Soul, is the Influence of the Holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into the ſoul. Now this abſolutely neceſſary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence is that which is never wanting to any one Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſoul: The Covenant of Grace that the Lord freely paſſeth to the believing ſoul, lays an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Bleſſed God, to maintain the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Life of the ſoul; So that the Bleſſed God of Heaven and Earth is no more at Liberty, in that he is Bound and Obliged to Maintain that Life
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:48673:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he begets in a believing ſoul; According to that in <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. I will put my fear in their Hearts, and they ſhall not depart from me; they ſhall never dye again a ſpiritual death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The abſolute neceſſary Influence of the ſpirit, is that which maintains the Growth of the believing ſoul toward Perfection. Now that Influence of the ſpirit alſo, the Lord hath abſolutely engaged in the Covenant of Grace, to communicate at all times to a believing ſoul, in regard he hath engaged to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the likeneſs of Jeſus Chriſt in every believing ſoul, and therefore the ſpirit doth continually iſſue down life from the head of the Lord Jeſus, into every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſoul which is a Member unto that Head: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Member receives from the Head continually ſome kind of vertue. Now both theſe Influences of the ſpirit being abſolutely neceſſary, though they be free originally, yet the Lord having paſſed his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to ſinners embracing the promiſe, he ſtands ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to Communicate thoſe Influences of the ſpirit continually. But now this other Influence is a free Influence in another manner; It is not abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Life nor Growth of the ſoul, in this manner that we are now ſpeaking of, and therefore the Lord is not engaged to Communicate it unto the ſouls of his People, but he ſtands at his own Liberty, to Diſpence it to whom he will, to ſend this Exciting ſpirit into what ſoul he pleaſes out of the number of all believing ſouls. So that it may in an eminent ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative manner, be ſaid of this Exciting work of the ſpirit to the believing Diſpoſition, what Chriſt ſaith of the Breathing of the ſpirit in general, that the ſpirit breatheth where it liſteth; It is meerly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the good pleaſure of the Lord, that any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:48673:184"/>
ſoul partake of this Exciting work of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to the believing Diſpoſition.</p>
               <p n="3">III. You muſt obſerve in the Deſcription, That it is a Gratious, Free, and Extraordinary Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſpirit with the believing Diſpoſition infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. There is an ordinary Exciting Influence of the ſpirit to the believing Diſpoſition: no Gratious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition Infuſed would ſhew forth any of its Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did not the ſpirit Concur with the Gratious Diſpoſition, and ſo conſequently there would be no Operation of Faith at all: Now in regard there are conſtant Operations of Faith in every believing ſoul, in the courſe of his Converſion, in one degree or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, therefore it muſt needs be concluded, there is an ordinary Concurrence of the ſpirit, into the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Diſpoſition that is in every believing ſoul: But this Exciting Influence into the believing ſoul that I now ſpeak of, is not that ordinary, but it is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary; It is an abundant Breathing of the ſpirit upon the believing Diſpoſition, mightily drawing it forth into Exerciſe in its full Strength and Power, cauſing the believing Diſpoſition to be Victorious, and Triumph Gloriouſly over all Doubts, Objections, and Queſtions. This is the ſpirits Excitation of the believing Diſpoſition infuſed into the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Now we may conceive that there are three Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular acts of the ſpirit on the ſoul, that may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded under the ſpirits Excitation of the believing Diſpoſit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on in the ſoul, which do all tend unto the Full, Powerful, Mighty Excitation of the believing Diſpoſition in the ſoul unto exerciſe.</p>
               <p n="1">I. It affects the Heart ſweetly with the Pretious Divine Light Diſcovered unto the ſoul, by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the Goſpel to it. The light of truth
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:48673:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Diſcoveries affects not the Heart any further, than the ſpirit concurs with the Light Revealed. Now,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſpirit cauſeth the ſoul to be filled with a Holy Complacency, in beholding the Pretious Divine Light that the Goſpel Reveals.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſpirit moves an inſatiable Thirſt in the ſoul, after the continuance of that Pretious Divine Light ſhining from the Goſpel, into his Poor Obſcure Heart.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſpirit melts the Heart by the beholding that Light that the ſpirit puts into it, ſo as the Heart is made moſt pretiouſly Tender, and Pliable, and Flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Bleſſed Will of God in every thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Spirit</hi> impels, conſtrains the <hi>Soul</hi> to believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrongly. The Lord rules in the heart of believers by the Royal <hi>Scepter</hi> of his Word, but not as the Word is barely revealed unto a Soul in the letter of it, but as the Word is brought into the heart by his own Spirit. And therefore when the Spirit ſways not the Scepter of the Word in their hearts, the word looſeth its Imperial Royal Authority that it hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Soul,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Soul</hi> lies not under ſo ſtrong an Obligation to any Duty, as it doth when the <hi>Spirit</hi> brings the Word to the heart.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Act is the inabling the ſoul powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to believe: According to that in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13: By him we receive both to will and to do, that is, both the diſpoſition, and the Act of the Diſpoſition, both an inward bent of <hi>Spirit</hi> to believe, and power alſo to act that Diſpoſition, <hi>This is that mighty Power that works in thoſe that believe,</hi> Eph. 1.19. So that the <hi>Soul</hi> that could only Believe waveringly, that it was the Lords will to receive his deſpicable, loveleſs <hi>Soul</hi> into union with the Lord Jeſus, ſhall by the powerful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:48673:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the <hi>Spirit</hi> infuſed into the <hi>Soul</hi> by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> be able to receive it fixedly, to believe it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, unqueſtionably, without the leaſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy for the preſent, that the bleſſed <hi>God</hi> of Love, will out of his own free love, accept his deſpicable loveleſs <hi>Soul</hi> into the neareſt union with the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and himſelf through him. That is the exciting work of the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is now the fifth and laſt work of the ſpirit unto ſouls for that end to be opened, which is the ſpirits Atteſtation to the ſoul,<note place="margin">The Spirits Attestation.</note> that is to ſay his Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto the ſoul that it ſhall be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, Infallibly, in its Cleaving to Lord Jeſus, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into Union and Communion with him. It is the good pleaſure of the Lord, not only to ſhew the immutability of his Counſel concerning believing ſouls, and the infallibility of their acceptance into Union and Communion with the Lord Jeſus in their ſouls cleaving to him; but it is alſo the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Lord to ſhew more than Sufficiency, the Unchangableneſs of his Counſel to ſuch ſouls: Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that Pretious place. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.17. The Lord willing more abundantly to ſhew the Immutability of his Councel: <hi>Ex Abundanti</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> Tranſlates the Original; The Lord having a Pretious good will to ſhew, in a way more and beyond what was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to believing ſouls, the Impoſſibility of their ſouls failing of Union and Communion with the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in their cleaving to him, he doth therefore now add his Bleſſed Spirit to be the Comforter of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſouls, not only in a Degree that is neceſſary for them, (for which end all thoſe four former Effects of the ſpirit upon ſouls were appointed) but the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:48673:186"/>
Lord appoints the Spirit to be a Comforter beyond what is neceſſary: And therefore after the Spirit hath given to Believing ſouls, a clear Evidence of their Acceptance into Union with the Lord Jeſus, ſo as thereby the ſpirit had filled their ſouls with ſtrong Conſolation; Yet the Lord appoints the Spirit to add a higher work, which is its Atteſtation. This Atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the Spirit is that you ſhall find <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. <hi>In whom alſo after that ye Believed, ye were Sealed with the Holy Spirit of promiſe:</hi> Or as the Word may be rendered, <hi>In whom Believing ye were Sealed,</hi> which Imports the neer Conjunction of theſe two Bleſſed works of the Spirit, or the immediate following of the Spirits Atteſtation, upon the Spirits Excitation of their Souls to Believing. And this work of the Spirit is that you find alſo in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21, 22. <hi>Now he that Eſtabliſheth us with you in Chriſt, and hath Annointed us, is God, who hath alſo Sealed us, and given us the earneſt of the Spirit in our Hearts.</hi> And this you ſhall find alſo. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. <hi>Grieve not the Spirit of God by which you are Sealed unto the day of Redemption.</hi> And ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>The Spirit it ſelf beareth Witneſs with our Spirit tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> we are the Children of God.</hi> Now leaſt any ſhould queſtion whether the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth thus work in a Witneſſing way, it would be neceſſary to clear the Interpretation of moſt of thoſe places from ſome other Gloſſes that are Frequently put upon them. It is true ſay ſome, the Scripture ſpeaks of the Sealing work of the Spirit unto Souls, but the meaning of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth is only, that by Graces and Holy Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, that the Spirit Communicates unto Believing Souls, it doth confirm Souls in the certainty of their Acceptance into Union with Chriſt: So that by the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:48673:186"/>
receiving of the Spirit by Belive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, ſpoken of in the Scripture of Truth, is only meant Believers receiving the Precious Working of the Spirit in their Hearts, in Holy Habits and Dipſoſitions.</p>
               <p>For Anſwer, I muſt acknowledge that by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is frequently meant in Scripture, the Holy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions infuſed by the Sanctifying Spirit into Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Souls. And I muſt acknowledge alſo, that the Graces or Holy Habits infuſed by the Spirit in Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Souls, are ſpoken of as Witneſſes unto Souls of their Union with Chriſt: And indeed it is queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that an effect may Witneſs its own proper cauſe: And the Scripture ſpeaks expreſly, that the works of God are <hi>Witneſs of God, Act.</hi> 14.17. And ſo Chriſts works were <hi>Witneſſes of his Godhead, John</hi> 5.36. Yet this is not that which is primarily intended in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Scriptures by the Spirits Sealing the Believing Soul, which may appear to you by two or three Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In regard the Spirits Sealing the Believing Soul, is declared to follow the Souls act of Believing in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Nature. As in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. <hi>In whom after ye Believed ye were Sealed.</hi> Or, <hi>In whom ye Believing were Sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promiſe.</hi> Now all the Pretious Holy Habits, that the Sanctifying Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Infuſes into any Soul, are in order of Nature Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before there is any Believing act in the Soul: Though the Believing act in a Believing Soul may be Contemporary (that is at one and the ſame time) yet the Infuſing of all the Holy Habits and Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into the Soul, muſt be conceived to have a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency in order of Nature, before there can be a Believing act. I confeſs ſome (and thoſe learned ones too) have imagined, that the Sanctifying Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:48673:187"/>
ſhould work as an external agent, an outward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent upon the Soul in the firſt act of Believing, and then take up its Habitation in the Soul through the Souls Believing in the Lord Jeſus. But reaſon it ſelf is ſufficient Confutation of thoſe Imaginations. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will tell us of an Impoſſibility of a man meerly Unregenerate, to put forth an act meerly Spiritual; Reaſon will tell us an Habit or Diſpoſition muſt go before there be an act, a Tree there muſt be before there can be fruit; And then alſo the Spirits Sealing of the Believing Soul being declared to follow, at leaſt in order of nature, the Souls Believing, it cannot be that by the Spirits Sealing ſpoken of in theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſhould be meant the Infuſion of the Spirits Graces into the Soul: it muſt be ſomething beſides the Graces Infuſed.</p>
               <p n="2">II. All kind of Holy Habits or Diſpoſitions, that are Infuſed into any one Believing Soul, are Infuſed in order of nature before the Souls Believing. Now if the Spirits Sealing were only the Infuſion of the Spirits Grace, then every Believing Soul ſhould have the ſame Seal of the Spirit, whereas experience brings Teſtimony enough to the contrary.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The Spirits Sealing mentioned in thoſe former Scriptures is Attributed in a particular manner to the perſon of the Spirit, <hi>The Spirit it ſelf beareth Witneſs with our Spirits:</hi> It doth not ſay only, the Spirit, which might have been meant the Graces of the ſpirit, but the ſpirit it ſelf, even by a perſonal act the ſpirit atteſts to us that, <hi>we are the Sons of God.</hi> So it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13, 14. <hi>In whom alſo after ye Believed, ye were Sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promiſe, which is the earneſt of our Inheritance.</hi> It is Tranſlated <hi>Which,</hi> but it is moſt agreeable to the Original, to
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:48673:187"/>
ſay, <hi>Who</hi> is the earneſt of our Inheritance; The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative being in the perſon of the ſpirit, not the Gifts of the ſpirit. So that it ſtands as an Undoubted Truth, that the Lord doth add unto Believing ſouls for their abundant Conſolation, even a Witneſs from his own Bleſſed ſpirit of their admittance into Union and Communion with the Lord Jeſus in their clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to him, beſides all thoſe other Bleſſed neceſſary works of the Bleſſed ſpirit upon their ſouls.</p>
               <p>Now I muſt further Obſerve, that this Atteſtation of the ſpirit doth not pertain peculiarly and ſolely unto Faith, as having reference unto Faith only, and to the begetting of aſſurance of Faith; But by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Appointment this Witneſs of the ſpirit pertains alſo to ſenſe, to ſpiritual ſenſe, or ſpiritual Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and doth beget aſſurance of Sence and Feeling, as well as it begets aſſurance of Faith; Yet there is ſuch a ſweet Mixture in this Bleſſed work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits Atteſtation, that it doth at one and the ſame time raiſe the ſoul to aſſurance of Faith, and Aſſurance of Senſe and Feeling: And indeed ſuch is the nature of the ſpirits Atteſtation, that it never bears Witneſs to the ſouls Faith in any meaſure of clearneſs, that the ſoul in its Cleaving to the Lord Jeſus ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into Union and Communion with Chriſt, but the ſpirit bears Witneſs at the ſame time to the ſouls ſence, that it is actually admitted into Union and Communion with Chriſt. Yet becauſe we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at preſent of the manner how the ſpirit doth firſt reveal to the ſouls Faith certainly, and infallibly his Union with Chriſt, and ſo aſſure the ſouls Faith of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, we muſt firſt ſpeak of the ſpirits Atteſtation unto the ſoul in reference unto Faith. Though we muſt alſo for opening the full work of Atteſtation,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:48673:188"/>
open the manner of the ſpirits Atteſting to the ſouls Sence and Feeling.</p>
               <p>For the opening the firſt, the ſpirits Atteſtation in Reference unto the ſouls Faith, to aſſure Faith of its Union,<note place="margin">The Spirits At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation unto Faith.</note> I ſhall open to you two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Thoſe Reſpects in which the Lord doth appoint the ſpirits Atteſtation to be added to all the former works, as a Redundancy of his Mercy and Love to the Deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoul.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We ſhall open what the ſpirits Atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſouls Faith is.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, There are four or five Reſpects, why the Lord adds this work of Atteſtation to the ſouls Faith, after he hath perſwaded the ſoul to believe thus powerfully with Confidence.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In reſpect of the Multitude of fears that remain in the Believing Soul, after the cleareſt Evidence of the Goſpel unto the ſoul, and the moſt full perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoul by the ſpirit to Believe. There are three kinds of fears that ſtill remain in ſome degree, both in the Seed of them, and in the Fruit of them, though none of them remain in their abſolute Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is both the Seed and Fruit of Slaviſh Fear. Though through the Mighty Exciting Power of the ſpirit, following the ſpirits Irradiation and Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the Goſpel to the ſoul, it is raiſed to a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Confidence, of the Lords Acceptance of his ſoul, into Union and Communion with the Lord Jeſus in his Cleaving to him, yet there is not a perfection of Confidence; And it is only perfect Confidence that begets perfect love, and only perfect Love that caſts out Slaviſh Fear.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:48673:188"/>2. There is a pure natural fear that ſtill remains. The matter of Believing is of ſuch high concernment, that the very remembrance of it ſtrikes the ſoul with ſome natural fear; It is the venturing the pretious Immortal ſoul for Eternity, and unleſs there were a Perfection of Confidence, a ſoul cannot be void of fear.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a Spiritual Holy fear that remains alſo in the Believing ſoul, after the ſtrength of Believing. The ſouls Viſion of Union and Communion with Chriſt, Inflames the Believing Souls Heart with Love unto Union and Communion: And proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the degree of the Souls Love, ſo is the Souls fear; That is to ſay, the Soul fears the loſs of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Communion, in the ſame degree wherein he loves Union and Communion, and this fear is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prone to go beyond its Bounds, and to ſuſpect the loſs of it, where there is no cauſe of Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Lord adds this Atteſting work of the ſpirit to ſouls, In regard there is a natural Diſtruſt that in ſome degree remains in every Believing ſoul, though raiſed to a fulneſs of Confidence. There is not only an Indiſpoſition naturally in the ſoul, to give Credit to the Bleſſed Word of the Majeſty of Heaven, by reaſon of its Inability, fully to comprehend the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Lords fulfilling ſuch a Word into his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; But alſo there is a natural Diſpoſition in dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in every ſoul, that Inclines the Heart ſtrongly to give the Bleſſed Majeſty of Heaven the Lye, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt that Bleſſed Record that the Lord bears of his own Son.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:48673:189"/>III. There is a Holy Jealouſie that poſſeſſeth eve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry Believing Soul, leaſt his Corrupt Deceitful Heart ſhould Delude him. Every Believing ſoul is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to himſelf, of a Multiplicity and Variety of Couzening Deluding Tricks, that his Corrupt Heart hath put upon him from time to time, as it dare not truſt its Heart when it deals moſt Plainly and Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly. Now from this Holy Jealouſie, there ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a Difficulty to ſettle and Eſtabliſh the Heart, and to free it from all Wavering in its Conſcience: Now in reſpect of this, the Lord adds this work of the ſpirits Atteſtation, that the ſoul may have a full Satisfaction, that there may be no inward Misgivings of Heart, in its Confidence of the Lords acceptance of it into Union and Communion with the Lord Jeſus, in its Cleaving and Adhering to him.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. There is a natural Unconſtancy, that poſſeſſeth every ſuch Believing ſoul in ſome degree. Ever ſince the Heart of Man was drawn from that firſt Bleſſed Center, it hath naturally been Unconſtant in all its Reſtings: Now from this Unconſtancy of the ſpirit, the Heart is exceeding prone to have its Confidence ſhaken when the ſpirit hath raiſed it to a high De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; And in reſpect of that the Lord Vouchſafeth to add the work of Atteſtation, for the perfect Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of the Wavering Soul.</p>
               <p n="5">V. There is all the Concurrent Rage of Hell Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, againſt every Soul attaining that Confidence of his Acceptance into Union and Communion with the Lord Jeſus in his Adhering to him. Now ſhould there not be a Witneſs from Heaven, or greater Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the ſouls Apprehenſion, than any Dictates of the Counſel of Hell, the Believing ſoul would ſoon call in queſtion the Pretious Word of the Majeſty of
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:48673:189"/>
Heaven, and Incline to give Credit to the Dictates of Hells Counſel. Therefore in reſpect to this, leaſt the Believing ſoul through this means, ſhould be Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of that Pretious Joy and Peace in Believing, that the Lord intends, the Lord hath Determined that his Bleſſed ſpirit ſhould become the ſouls Comforter, by way of Atteſtation to bear Witneſs to the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the ſouls Acceptance into Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Lord Jeſus, in the ſouls Cleaving to him, that ſo the Witneſs of Heaven might be of higher Authority to the ſoul, than all thoſe Curſed Lying Dictates of Hell frequently propounded to that Believing ſoul.</p>
               <p>Now the ſecond thing to be opened is, what this Atteſtation, or Witneſs unto the ſouls Faith is?<note place="margin">What the Spirits Atteſtation unto Faith is.</note> I conceive that this Atteſtation unto Faith, is a Pretious Beam of Heavenly Light, darted into the Underſtanding, whereby the ſpirit clearly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrateth to the Believing ſoul, the Lords Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the ſouls act of Believing or Confidence, and that with ſuch an unſpeakable Divine Authority, as is irreſiſtable by the ſoul, ſo that hereby the ſoul is Eſtabliſhed in a Plerophery, or more than a fulneſs of Confidence.</p>
               <p>There are four things in this Deſcription that you muſt obſerve.</p>
               <p n="1">I. This Atteſtation unto Faith is a Pretious Beam of Heavenly Light, darted into the Underſtanding. That is the nature of the Witneſs: This is (as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called by Divines, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſtians) a ſecret Voice, or a ſweet Whiſpering of the ſpirit: And thence many have ſadly Miſtaken, and Conceived
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:48673:190"/>
that Witneſs to be ſome ſtrange kind of Revelation by a Voice from Heaven; But indeed it is therefore ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, as a ſecret Voice, becauſe it is a ſecret Beam of Heavenly Light: And thence it is rightly called the Witneſs of the Spirit of the Lord, Witneſſing with our Spirits that we are the Sons of God: Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that is, bear Record, give a Teſtimony; Now to give a Teſtimony is to declare a thing Verbally: Now indeed in this reſpect, it is not unfitly called the Voice of the Spirit; for a Voice is nothing elſe but an Expreſſion of the inward Conception of the mind by words: Now by this ſecret Beam of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Light, darted into the underſtanding, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord doth ſecretly expreſs the mind of God.</p>
               <p n="2">II. This Atteſtation or Witneſs of the ſpirit unto Faith, is ſuch a Beam of Heavenly Light as doth Clearly, and Infallibly, and Unqueſtionably, Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate or Manifeſt to the ſoul, the Lords Approbation of his act of Believing, or of his act of Confidence. All the Unquiet Toſſings and Agitations, and Perplexing Waverings of ſouls, from what occaſion ſoever, they have their Original in ſome kind of Doubting, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be according to the Bleſſed Will of God, that their Forlorn, Deſpicable ſouls, ſhould be ſo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of their Acceptance into Union with the Lord Jeſus, in their adhering to him: Now therefore the Light that the ſpirit caſts into the Underſtanding, is on purpoſe to clear, and make it out of all doubt to the ſoul, that it is Infinitely pleaſing to the Bleſſed God, that even that particular ſoul ſhould be ſo Confident of his Acceptance into Union with the Lord Jeſus. That is the matter it ſelf that the ſpirit doth Teſtify to the ſoul, or the Teſtimony it giveth.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:48673:190"/>III. You muſt obſerve in the Deſcription, That this Atteſtation of the Spirit is ſuch a Beam of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Light, that ſo clears to the Believing Soul, the Lords Approbation of his act of Believing, or his act of Confidence, that it carrieth along with it an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable Divine Authority. It is ſuch a Beam of Light as hath ſuch an Impreſſion of the Majeſty of the Bleſſed God upon it, that it is impoſſible for the Heart to make Reſiſtance.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Obſerve in the Deſcription, that it Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Soul in a Plerophery, a more than a fulneſs of Confidence, a Triumphing Confidence. That is the peculiar Inſeparable effect of this Teſtimony that the ſpirit gives, it fixeth the Wavering Unconſtant Soul. This is the Spirits Atteſtation unto Faith. Now we ſhall come to the Spirits Atteſtation unto Sence; But there is an Objection will be caſt in, that muſt firſt be opened, whereby the depth of this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Myſtery may be ſomething more Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Some Soul may ſay, If the Spirit giveth no other Teſtimony to the Soul than this, That his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Soul ſhall be Certainly and Infallibly Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Union and Communion with the Lord Jeſus, in his Adhering to him, and Produce no other Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Soul than this, that I, even I, this Unlove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Soul of mine, in Adhering to the Lord Jeſus ſhall Infallibly have Union and Communion with him to all Eternity, then ſaith the Soul, even after the Witneſs of the Spirit unto the Soul, it may remain doubtful of its Union with Chriſt ſtill, ſeeing by this Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Spirit unto Faith, the Soul is not aſſured of his own Cleaving and Adhering unto Chriſt, and
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:48673:191"/>
ſeeing the certainty that the Spirit giveth, by the Teſtimony to the Souls Faith of his Union with Chriſt, hath its whole Dependance upon the certainty of the Souls Cleaving and Adhering unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. For Anſwer to this Grand Objection,</p>
               <p>Firſt, When this Teſtimony of the Spirit is given unto the Souls Faith, and he is aſſured that his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, Unlovely, Forlorn Soul, ſhall certainly and Infallibly be accepted into union with the Lord Jeſus in his reſting upon Chriſt for union, it is not then poſſible that there ſhould be any Solid Ground for that Believing Soul, to queſtion his own Cleaving and Adhering unto Jeſus Chriſt unto all Eternity. And that will appear in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In regard there is a ſufficient ground revealed to the Soul, that hath this Teſtimony of the Spirit unto his Faith, of his Confidence of his Everlaſting Cleaving unto Chriſt, as there is of the Lords Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of his Soul into Union and Communion with him in Adhering to him. The promiſes of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace that are tendred in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, do as perfectly and as clearly, contain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in them ſtrength to inable Souls to Embrace and Accept thoſe Promiſes, as they do contain in them a fulneſs and alſufficiency of Love and Mercy for thoſe Souls that do Embrace them. The Lord that hath ſaid, It is my Will that ſuch Periſhing, Sinking, Deſpicable Souls as will accept my Tender, ſhall be one with me through the Lord Jeſus, and have Everlaſting Communion with me, hath alſo ſaid,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:48673:191"/>
will Allure and draw your Hearts to Embrace and Accept according to my Will, this Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with me in Chriſt that I freely tender you. According to <hi>Jer.</hi> 31, 32, 33. <hi>This ſhall be my Covenant, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and Write it in their Hearts:</hi> That is to ſay, I will infuſe ſutable Diſpoſitions into the Hearts of all the Embracers of the Lord Jeſus, to Incline, Diſpoſe, and Inable them to fulfil all my Revealed Will in ſome Meaſure and Degree. So that the Soul hath as ſure a Word Revealed to it to depend upon, from whence may ariſe a Confidence in it, that the Lord will Inable him to Cleave and Adhere Everlaſtingly to Chriſt, as it hath a Word whereupon his Soul may Depend, and may be Confident, the Lord will accept him into Union and Communion with him in Cleaving unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">II. In regard that very Confidence that the Spirit doth produce in the Soul, of its Infallible Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into Union and Communion with him, is the very act of Cleaving and Adhering unto Chriſt. There are four particular acts of the Soul, Included under this Confidence of the Souls Acceptance into U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt in its Cleaving and Adhering to him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In this is Included the Election of Union with Chriſt, by the Will of the Soul. Now this is but the receiving of Chriſt that the Goſpel requireth; To as many as received him to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. Now the conſent of the Will to cloſe with Chriſt in Union and Communion that is tendred to it, is the very Receiving of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:48673:192"/>2. In that very act of Confidence there is Inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Souls Credence, or giving Credit to the Word of God. When the Soul is Confident of the Lords Accepting of it into Union and Communion with him, in the Souls Cleaving and Adhering to him, it is only becauſe of ſuch a Word of Promiſe from the Mouth of Chriſt, to which the Soul giveth Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, or which the Soul Believeth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In this act of Confidence there is a Reſignation of the Soul wholly unto Chriſt. Such as that which is ſpoken of in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>I know whom I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and I am Perſwaded that he is able to keep that which I have Committed unto him:</hi> That is to ſay, I know whoſe Word it was that I gave Credit to, and that I was ſo Confident of the Truth of, That I lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Soul upon the Truth of that Word for its Everlaſting Happineſs. So that then in this act of Confidence, there is Included that Mutual Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable Covenanting, that the Word of the Lord requires from Souls in Accepting the Lord Jeſus Tendered.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In this very act of Confidence there is Inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a full Dependance of the Soul upon Chriſt, a hanging the Soul upon the Faithfulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt and his Word. So that indeed all the acts that the Goſpel Requires from Souls are Included in this one act of Confidence that is produced by this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Spirit to the Souls Faith: Now the act of the Souls Confidence, being alſo the act of its Cleaving and Adhering unto the Lord Jeſus, and the Souls Cleaving and Adhering unto Chriſt being Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually as ſtrong, as the act of its Confidence of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting into Union and Communion with Chriſt, in his Cleaving to him; Thence it appears that there can
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:48673:192"/>
be no ſolid ground of the ſouls queſtioning his own Adherence unto the Lord Jeſus, when the ſpirit gives this Teſtimony forementioned unto the ſouls Faith, and produceth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Confidence in the ſoul, of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance into Union and Communion with the Lord Jeſus in Adhering to him. In this very thing lies the whole Myſtery of aſſurance unto Faith; The very Confidence that the ſpirit begets in the ſoul, of the Lord Jeſus his Accepting it into Union and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him in Cleaving to him, the very act of Confidence is the act of the ſouls Cleaving to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Secondly I Anſwer further, that whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Spirit by its Teſtimony to the ſouls Faith, doth beget that Confidence in the ſoul, that the Lord will Accept it into Union with himſelf, in his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to him, then the ſoul cannot queſtion his own Adhering unto Chriſt, any more than he queſtions the Lords Acceptance of his ſoul into Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him in his Adhering to him. The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits Teſtimony unto Faith is or ſuch a nature, that it doth equally beget a Confidence in the ſoul, of his Everlaſting Cleaving unto Chriſt, to the Confidence that it doth beget, of the Lords Acceptance of the ſoul into Union with himſelf in the ſouls Adhering to him. And that will appear in three things.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In regard the ſpirits Atteſtation unto Faith, is concerning the truth of the whole Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, or of all the promiſes. The ſpirit in the Irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of the Goſpel, clears that it is the Lords Will to have the whole Glorious work of the Union of Loveleſs Sinners with the Lord Jeſus, to have its ſole dependance upon himſelf; So that it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:48673:193"/>
Believing Strength to inable the ſoul to Cleave and Adhere to the Lord Jeſus, fully to be tendered in the Covenant of Grace, as well as Union with Chriſt himſelf is tendered: Now then the ſpirits At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, which follows this Irradiation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, is as large as its Irradiation work, I mean, the ſpirit doth in a Judicial, Authoritative way, Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the truth of all thoſe Goſpel Truths Revealed to the ſoul: So that the ſoul cannot poſſibly reſiſt that Determination, that the ſpirit gives into its Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom. Now then there being the ſame Witneſs of the ſpirit unto the ſouls Faith, that the Lord will inable it to Cleave and Adhere to the Lord Jeſus, that there is unto its Faith, that the Lord will Accept into Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Communion with himſelf in Chriſt, every ſoul that will Adhere to him; Thence it cannot be that a ſoul ſhould more queſtion his Adhering unto Chriſt, than he ſhould queſtion the Lords Acceptance of him into Union, through his Adhering to him.</p>
               <p n="2">II. In regard the ſpirits Excitation of the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Diſpoſition into Exerciſe, is General and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal. Now there being ſtrength to Inable the ſoul to Adhere unto Chriſt tendered, as well as Union with Jeſus Chriſt is tendered, and the ſpirits Exciting work being thus General and Univerſal, it cannot be but the Heart ſhould be Eſtabliſhed in the conſtant Expectation of the one as of the other; To be as Confident of the ſouls everlaſting Cleaving unto Chriſt, as of his Acceptance into Union with Chriſt, upon his Cleaving to him.</p>
               <p n="3">III. In regard the ſpirit doth Adjoyn a Teſtimony unto the ſoul, that it doth Cleave unto Chriſt, to its Teſtimony that it gives to its Faith, that it ſhall
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:48673:193"/>
be admitted to the Lord Jeſus infallibly, in cleaving unto him. The Spirit is ſo bleſſed a Comforter, that it ſends down living ſtreams of refreſhing, both to faith and ſpiritual ſenſe: when it hath once teſtified to the ſouls faith, that unqueſtionably and infallibly, that particular ſoul ſhall be accepted into union with the Lord Jeſus, in his embracing of him; it then alſo teſtifies to the ſoul, that it hath embraced Chriſt, and that the ſoul is already actually inſtated in union and communion with him. Now having opened the ſpirits atteſtation unto the ſouls faith:<note place="margin">The ſpirits atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation unto ſenſe.</note> The ſecond act of the atteſtation of the ſpirit, is it's atteſtation unto the ſouls ſpiritual ſenſe: in this we muſt open three things to you.</p>
               <p>Firſt that there is ſuch a witneſs of the ſpirit to the ſouls ſenſe and feeling, beſides the former Record that it gives unto Faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In what reſpects this witneſs of the ſpirit is added unto the ſpirits witneſs unto the ſouls faith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, what this witneſs of the ſpirit to the ſouls ſenſe and feeling is.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that there is ſuch a teſtimony of the ſpirit unto ſenſe and feeling, may appear from that one place alone, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>The ſpirit it ſelf beareth witneſs mith our ſpirits, that we are the ſons of God:</hi> this holds forth, that there muſt be a witneſs of the ſpirit unto the ſoul, above and beſides thoſe holy diſpoſitions, or precious gracious habits that the ſpirit doth communicate unto ſouls, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that there is ſuch a witneſs of the ſpirit unto faith. Now from hence appears, that there is ſuch a witneſs of the ſpirit unto the ſouls ſenſe and feeling,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:48673:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in that the ſpirit is ſaid to give a particular teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unto particular ſouls, of their actual union with the Lord Jeſus. <hi>The ſpirit witneſſeth with our ſpirits that we are the ſons of God;</hi> that we, it is not only a determinating ſentence, that the ſpirit paſſeth upon the truth of what the Goſpel reveals in general, unto every ſoul that ſhall embrace him, for that is only thus, that thou or thou, or that particular ſoul in his accepting the Lord Jeſus ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, ſhall infallibly be one with Chriſt; (which is ſtill a teſtimony unto faith) but the Scripture ſpeaks it plainly, the ſpirit gives teſtimony of their ſouls real accepting of Jeſus Chriſt tendered. The ſpirits teſtimony of ſaith could be only thus much, to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the promiſe, that this or that particular ſoul, ſhall be adopted to be a Child of the Bleſſed Majeſty of Heaven, in his accepting the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus tendered: But this teſtimony is a witneſs to the particular ſoul of it's actual adoption already, that we are the ſons of God, therefore this muſt be a teſtimony of the ſpirit unto the ſouls ſenſe and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, in regard the proper object of faith, is to receive what is promiſed, not receive what is done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſpirit is ſaid to be a Co-witneſs with believers ſpirits, that they are united unto Chriſt, and adopted ſons and daughters of God through their union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Saith the Original, the ſpirit doth bare witneſs together with our ſpirits; ſo that the ſpirit is ſaid here to bear witneſs to the ſoul, of the ſame things that the ſouls own ſpirit (that is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed underſtanding, or the ſanctified Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) bares witneſs to: Now the renewed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:48673:194"/>
in the believing ſoul, can only bear witneſs unto the ſouls ſenſe and feeling; and therefore the ſpiris witneſſing the ſame thing, that the renewed conſcience in a believing ſoul doth witneſs, it muſt needs be, that this witneſs of the ſpirit muſt be a witneſs to the ſouls ſenſe and feeling.</p>
               <p n="3">III. It appears from the peculiar office, to which the ſpirit of the Lord is deſtinated. The ſpirit is appointed to be the comforter, the moſt ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive eminent comforter: now ſhould not the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit witneſs unto the ſouls ſence and feel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally it's union with Chriſt, it could not comfort in the higheſt manner. There are three degrees of ſpiritual comfort.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A ſouls appehenſion that union and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Lord Jeſus, is tendered to his deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable loſt ſoul. There is a degree of comfort from the poſſibility, that his poor loſt ſinking ſoul may be admitted into union and communion with Chriſt; but alas this is weak.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is the ſouls actual embracing this u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Lord Jeſus tendered. There is infinite ſweetneſs and peace in that very believing act of the ſoul, though as yet there is no ſenſibleneſs in the ſoul of that his own believing, and ſo no ſenſibleneſs of his union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Which is the Top Stone of the Souls Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and that is the ſenſibleneſs of the ſouls union with the Lord through believing. Now if the ſpirit ſhould not give ſuch a witneſs to the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoul as this, to witneſs to the ſouls actual cloſe with Chriſt, in union and communion, the bleſſed ſpririt who is ſent from the Lord Jeſus, on purpoſe to be a comfort to believing ſouls, ſhould
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:48673:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not comfort in the higheſt manner, he ſhould not be the moſt eminent comforter.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond thing to be opened, is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the additions of the ſpirits teſtimony unto the ſouls ſenſe and feeling, to the teſtimony that it gives to the ſouls faith. There are five or ſix reaſons of it;</p>
               <p n="1">I. To prevent the ſouls receiving that determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its corrupt conſcience concerning its everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting eſtate. In all the various actings of conſcience, as a Law, Witneſs and Judge, it is corrupted by vertue of our firſt Tranſgreſſion; ſo that in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtate the ſoul remains, when its conſcience worketh according to its natural diſpoſition and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, it bears falſe witneſs, and paſſeth falſe judgement: Now therefore doth the Lord vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to add the ſpirits teſtimony of the ſouls union unto ſenſe and feeling, that the falſe ſentence that conſcience paſſeth upon the ſoul, might not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by it. There are three reſpects wherein the Lord vouchſafeth to add the ſpirits teſtimony to ſenſe unto the the teſtimony it gives to faith,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The depravedneſs and perverſeneſs of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in its teſtimony.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The unavoidableneſs of the ſouls hearing that teſtimony that conſcience gives, when the ſoul is once alive through the life of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The readineſs of the ſoul, naturally to concur and agree with the teſtimony of corrupted conſcience, while it bares witneſs againſt Faith.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is evident, in regard the ful bent of the ſpirit ſtands to judge of all things according to ſenſe and reaſon. Now therefore the Lord adds this teſtimony of the ſpirit unto ſenſe and
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:48673:195"/>
feeling, to give matter for conſcience to build a new judgement upon, concerning the ſouls ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting eſtate.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Lord addeth the teſtimony of the ſpirit unto ſenſe and feeling, to its teſtimony unto faith, that the evidence of the ſouls union unto Chriſt, might every way counterpoiſe the evidences that the ſoul hath received of its ſeparation from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There are three evidences unto a ſoul of his ſeparation from Chriſt, and this teſtimony of the ſpirit unto ſenſe and feeling, doth parallel the ſoul with a ſufficient evidence of his union with Chriſt, anſwerable to thoſe three evidences of the ſouls ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration from Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is the bleſſed word of the Majeſty of Heaven, determining that every Son and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Adam,</hi> is by merrit and deſert everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeperated from the Lord Jeſus, and actually the firſt moment of his Being, void of union and communion with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is the evidence of the ſouls work.</p>
               <p>The contrary, oppoſite, rebellious working of the ſoul againſt Chriſt, doth evidently declare that there is no union between Chriſt and any ſoul na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally: as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8. <hi>He that committeth ſin,</hi> (that is, with full purpoſe and bent of ſpirit, with a full determination of his judgement and will) <hi>is of the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There is the teſtimony of conſcience founded upon theſe contrary workings of the Heart unto Chriſt that a ſoul is ſeperated from Chriſt. Now in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to theſe three, the ſpirit gives teſtimony unto faith, that even ſuch a particular deſpicable loſt ſinner, ſhall infallibly in his cleaving to the Lord Jeſus, enjoy
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:48673:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>
everlaſting union and communion with him: And then the Spirit adds this Teſtimony alſo unto ſenſe and feeling, whereby he makes the Soul diſcern even from the moving and working of his Heart towards the Lord Jeſus, that he is actually united to him; and from thence Conſcience cannot but bear witneſs, that the Soul is actually united unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The Lord doth vouchſafe to make a ſuper-addition of the Spirits Witneſs to ſenſe, that the whole bleſſed word of God might ſweetly concur together, in bearing Witneſs to the Souls union with the Lord Jeſus. As for example, that word in 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.13. Hereby we know that God dwells in us, and we in him, (that is, that we have union and communion with God in Chriſt) becauſe he hath given us of his Spirit. This vvord bears not Teſtimony to the Souls Faith of its union vvith Chriſt, but it bears Teſtimony unto the believing Souls ſenſe that is united, vvhen the Soul is ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the Spirit is conveyed from God into its Boſom. Likevviſe that other vvord in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves, whether you be in the faith, prove your own ſelves, know ye not your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you,</hi> (that is to ſay, that the life, and grace, and holineſs of Jeſus Chriſt is communicated to you, that Jeſus Chriſt acts and vvorks in you, and through you) knovv ye not this, <hi>except ye be Reprobates?</hi> Novv this Word bears no teſtimony to the Souls faith of its union vvith Chriſt, becauſe the indvvelling of Chriſt in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſoul, is not the object of Faith, but the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſpiritual ſight.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The Lord adds the teſtimony of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:48673:196"/>
unto the ſouls ſenſe, that believing ſouls might receive the earneſt of their everlaſting union with the Lord Jeſus here below, according to that, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. Ye were ſealed with the Holy ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which is the earneſt of our inheritance, until the redemption of the purchaſed poſſeſſion. So in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. Who hath alſo ſealed us, and given us the earneſt of his ſpirit in our hearts. The ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt imports two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Lord giveth the ſoul part of his everlaſting portion before hand.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, That the Lord gives that ſmall portion as a pledge to aſſure the ſoul of the enjoyment of the full inheritance. Now in the ſpirits teſtifying unto ſenſe, the ſouls union, the ſpirit doth clearly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the very entrance of the ſoul into union, and its participation of ſome degree of union with Chriſt already, in regard it diſcovers ſome of the graces of Chriſt to be actually inherent in the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The Lord ſuperadds the teſtimony of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit unto ſenſe, unto its teſtimony unto faith that he might effect the fuller degree of conformity to his whole will in the ſoul. Two commands are impoſſible for the ſoul to yield a perfect obedience to, without this Teſtimony of the ſpirit to the ſouls ſenſe, of his union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The command of examining and proving the ſoul whether it be in Chriſt, and all commands of the like nature, that enjoyn the ſoul to examine whether this, or that fruit of the ſpirit be in the ſoul? whether love to God, or love to the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren be in the ſoul or no? There can be no effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual obedience to any command of that nature, without the ſpirits teſtimony to the ſouls ſenſe, of
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:48673:197"/>
his union with Chriſt, in regard it is the proper and peculiar Office of the ſpirit only, to diſcover all its pretious workings to the ſoul, to be in the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The command of perpetual rejoycing in the Lord, could not be effectually obeyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the teſtimony of the Spirit unto the ſouls ſenſe. Though indeed believing be the primary original of all ſpiritual joy, yet the ſouls ſenſe of its believing, is a neceſſary adjunct to make up the perfection of that ſpiritual joy.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The Lord adds the teſtimony of the ſpirit to the ſouls ſenſe of union with Chriſt, to his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to faith, that the believing ſoul might be filled with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory. All thoſe glorious portions of the Lords word, whereby believers are deſcribed by the pretious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of grace infuſed into their hearts, would be as ſo many ſtrong holds for the powers of Hell to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie in againſt the Believers ſoul, and would be turned by the policy of Hell into condemning ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences againſt the ſoul, ſo as the precious Tower of the ſouls conſolation would be always battered, the ſweeteſt ſtreams of comfort would always meet with one interruption or other, in their flowing down into the boſom of the ſoul; did not the Lord add the teſtimony of his ſpirit unto ſenſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits witneſs is unto ſenſe.</note>The third thing to be opened is, what the ſpirits atteſtation to the ſouls ſenſe, and feeling of his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion vvith Chriſt is. It is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, ſecret, immediate, clear, and authoritative ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiation of the ſouls believing act, or confidence, cauſing the truth, ſincerity, and uprightneſs of the heart in believing, to ſhine ſo reſplendently, that
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:48673:197"/>
the ſoul in the act of believing is made ſweetly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to it ſelf, that it doth rightly believe: whence the renewed Conſcience determines boldly, that the ſoul is everlaſtingly one with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>That I might the more perſpicuouſly unfold this work of the ſpirit, we ſhall take the deſcription in peices, and open it in parts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, You are to underſtand in the deſcription, the act of the ſpirit in this teſtimony unto ſenſe. The act is an act of irradiation, a cloathing the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſoul with a tranſparent glory and brightneſs. In a word, it is but a precious beam of Heavenly light, that the ſpirit caſts upon the act of believing, for indeed it is nothing elſe but light to faith, and light to ſenſe, that is the original of all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to believing ſouls. There are three acts to be obſerved concerning this irradiating work of the ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="1">I. It is an immediate irradiation; Nay it proceeds from that bleſſed ſpirit ſo immediately, that nothing can concur with the ſpirit in caſting that pretious light upon the ſouls believing act.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) It is ſo immediate, as none of the precious Ordinances of the Lord can properly be ſaid to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or produce inſtrumentally, this precious mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the ſouls believing act to it ſelf. Though it is frequently, yea conſtantly, through ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Ordinances, that the ſpirit doth vouchſafe, thus to irradiate or manifeſt to the believing ſoul, the truth of his own believing act, yet it is not by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of any of theſe Ordinances.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) It is ſuch an immediate work of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon the ſoul, that demonſtrations either from the antecedent or conſequent, from the cauſe, or
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:48673:198"/>
from the effect of believing, hath no place here. Though it is certain, there may be infallible demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations drawn by a believing ſoul, from the effect of his believing, that his heart was true, ſincere, and upright in believing, yet the Spirit doth ſo immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately manifeſt this believing act, in the truth, ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and uprightneſs of it, to the believing ſoul, that it doth not ſend the ſoul to this or that work, to ſee what holineſs, or ſtrength of love or affection unto Chriſt, nor what readineſs of heart to all obedience to the will of God, were the conſequence of his belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but the bleſſed ſpirit doth immediately in the very moment of the ſouls acting that believing act, caſt a beam of Heavenly light upon that very act, that there is evidence enough in the act it ſelf, that the act is a true believing act, according to the evidence of the Lords revealed will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This act of the ſpirit is ſuch an immediate act, that the ſpirit uſeth not the aſſiſtance of the diſcurſive power of the mind, to collect from the deſcription of true Believers in the word, that his act of believing is upright and ſincere, according to the Lords will. It is certain, that in the ſpirits irradiation of the ſouls believing act, it doth diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver clearly, infallibly, and unqueſtionably, all the properties whereby believers are deſcribed in the word, to be in the ſoul alſo, yet in this that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called the witneſs of the ſpirit unto ſenſe, in its manifeſting the believing act of the ſoul, it doth not make the diſcurſive power in the mind, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument whereby the ſoul ſhould compare together his own believing act, and the deſcription of the true believing act that the Lord requireth in the word, ſo as thence to collect by diſcourſe, that the believing act is true.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="381" facs="tcp:48673:198" rendition="simple:additions"/>2dly. It is a clear act, full of perſpicuity and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparency. The ſpirit in this irradiation caſts as clear a light upon the ſouls believing act, to make it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it ſelf, as the rational ſoul doth caſt a natural light upon its own natural act; ſo that it is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably evident to the ſoul, that his ſoul doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, as it is evident that the ſoul liveth, or that the ſoul wills, or that it hath a being.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. The act of the ſpirit in irradiating the ſouls believing act, is authoritative, irreſiſtibly power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. This beam of light that the Spirit caſts upon the believing ſouls act, hath ſuch a commanding power included in it, that it even commands the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>; yea, it commands undeniably, ſo as it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the believing ſoul to ſhut its eyes, but it muſt ſee.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond thing to be obſerved is, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this act of the ſpirit in its teſtimony unto ſenſe. The object named in the deſcription is, the ſouls believing act or confidence. That is to ſay, the very act of credit that the ſoul giveth to the bleſſed word of God, teſtifying that it is his will that that particular loveleſs ſouls ſhould adhere &amp; cleave to the Lord Jeſus to be one with him &amp; to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him; and likewiſe teſtifying, that in the ſouls giving credit to that word o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> God, it ſhall everlaſtingly enjoy union and communion with the Father, and the Son and Spirit. Now there are 4. things obſervable under this to prevent miſtakes.</p>
               <p n="1">I. You muſt obſerve, that it is only the preſent believing act, that is the object of the Spirits manifeſtation, or irradiation. The Spirit doth not caſt thoſe beams of Heavenly light upon the ſouls former and paſt acts of believing, though they have been multiplied, but only upon the preſent
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:48673:199"/>
momentany act of believing, that the Spirit hath drawn forth from the ſoul, by its manifeſting of the Goſpel, and revealing the tender of union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Jeſus Chriſt to the deſpicable ſinner, in its Glory and Brightneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">II. You are to obſerve, that the believing act of the ſoul is only the principal and primary Object of the ſpirits irradiation or manifeſtation. So that the ſpirit caſts beams of Heavenly Light upon no other act in the believing ſoul at preſent, but only upon that act commonly, the ſpirit doth at the ſame time ſo cloath the act of Love, with ſuch a Glorious ſplendor and brightneſs, as that's alſo viſible in the ſame moment to the believing ſoul, that it ſeeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably his Arms of Love graſping the Lord Jeſus, as well as he ſees the truth of his own confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Word of Chriſt, that he will admit him into union and communion with him.</p>
               <p n="3">III. You muſt obſerve the vertue of the ſpirits irradiating, or manifeſting this believing act to the ſoul. The Vertue of it is to diſcover the Truth, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and Uprightneſs of the heart in believing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Truth and Sincerity; To make it unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable and Undeniable to the believing ſoul, that his Wretched, Corrupt heart doth not delude nor deceive him, but that his heart doth rely with ſome degree of ſtrength, and embrace the Lord Jeſus tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring union and communion to the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It makes apparent the uprightneſs, that is, the ſtrait Conformity of the heart in ſome degree, to the rule and command of believing.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="383" facs="tcp:48673:199"/>IV. You may obſerve here, how the ſpirit is the earneſt of the ſouls everlaſting inheritance, or of the ſouls everlaſting union and communion with Chriſt. It is only as the ſpirit doth irradiate the ſouls believing act to it ſelf, that it becomes the earneſt of the ſouls inheritance; That is, that it becomes as a ſmall portion given by the Bleſſed Majeſty of Heaven to the ſoul in hand, in Teſtimony that it ſhall injoy the full inheritance. The ſpirit is ſuch an earneſt in irradiating the ſouls believing act three ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard the ſpirit manifeſts its own preſence in the believing ſoul, by its irradiating the ſouls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving act, in diſcovering to the believing ſoul, that it doth uprightly according to the Will of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. It doth diſcover Holineſs to be infuſed into the ſoul, and ſo conſequently diſcover it ſelf to have taken up its Habitation in the believing ſoul. So that the believing ſoul, by the ſight that the ſpirit puts into the believing act, making it Viſible to his own eye, diſcerns the preſence of the holy ſpirit in his heart; and thus indeed there is a pretious earneſt given to the ſoul of his everlaſting union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard the communion between Jeſus Chriſt and the ſoul, by the ſight of his believing act, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to the ſoul to be begun. The ſoul diſcerns Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt and himſelf to be partakers of one and the ſame life, by diſcerning infallibly the truth of his own believing act.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard it enters the ſoul into the very frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of union with Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a firſt Fruit of Heaven, gives it actual poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that higheſt bleſſedneſs that ſanctifyed ſouls ſhall poſſeſs in Heaven. The fruition of it conſiſts in two things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:48673:200"/>Firſt, In the certain knowledge that it hath of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and communion with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the ſenſe of the ſweetneſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of union and communion with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Nothing though it be poſſeſſed, can be ſaid to be enjoyed, unleſs the party poſſeſſed of it hath a ſenſe of the ſweetneſs and comfort of the good that he is poſſeſſed of.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The third thing obſervable is, the effect of the manifeſtation, or the enlightning of the believing act in the ſoul. That is a pretious, ſweet conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the believing ſoul in his very act of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that he doth rightly believe, It is by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits irradiation of the pretious Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt to the ſouls underſtanding, that the ſoul diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns by faith the boſom of that bleſſed Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the Lord Jeſus, ready to receive his loveleſs, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, ſinking ſoul, into the neareſt union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him: ſo likewiſe by the ſpirits irradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the ſouls believing act, the ſpirit makes the ſoul ſee alſo as clearly, that it doth, as it were, creep into the open boſom of the love of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The fourth and laſt thing obſervable in the deſcription of the ſpirits witneſs to the ſouls ſenſe of its union and communion with the Lord Jeſus, is the inſeparable adjunct, or concomitant teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ſpirit unto ſenſe. That's the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the renewed Conſcience in the believing ſoul, that he is everlaſtingly one with Chriſt. This is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the effect of the ſpirits teſtimony unto ſenſe, whereas the light of every Grace (though they be luminous Bodies, and proceed from the ſpirit of light) is ſuch a ſmall light in it ſelf, that unleſs there be an addition by the Spirit unto
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:48673:200"/>
ſenſe, it ſhines not apparently to the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul; and therefore the infallible teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Believers own Spirit, or of his renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Underſtanding or Conſcience, is but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation, or the conſequent of the Spirits ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiating the Souls believing act; yet it is inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from it; no ſooner hath the Spirit witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Souls ſenſe, that it is one with Chriſt, but the renewed Conſcience anſwers alſo, Thou art one with Chriſt. The witneſs of the Believers Spirit, or of the renewed Conſcience is but the Eccho of the witneſs of the Lords own Spirit, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1. <hi>My Conſcience bearing me witneſs in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> It is the Spirit, as it were, that puts words into the mouth of renewed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; it doth but anſwer what is the voice of the Holy Spirit, as the Eccho anſwers our voyce. Now when the Spirit hath witneſſed unto the Souls Faith, that in its cleaving to the Lord Jeſus, his Soul ſhall be infallibly admitted into Union and Communion with him, and in that witneſs hath drawn out the believing diſpoſition to act in its ſtrength, and then caſts a brightneſs and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor upon the believing act, that it ſhineth thus apparently in the Souls eye, yea ſo apparently, that the renewed Conſcience bears witneſs that the Soul doth rightly believe; then doth the Soul ſay with thoſe in 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.16. I know and believe the Love that the Father of the Lord Jeſus bears to this my Loveleſs Soul; then is the poor wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Soul eſtabliſhed and ſetled as upon an everlaſting Rock, the Rock of Ages.</p>
               <p>Then, 1. All the beginnings of Hell in his own Spirit are paſt. All the condemning Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:48673:201"/>
of Conſcience that he was wont to hear every day, are obliterated and blotted out; I mean, ſo long as the teſtimony of the Spirit thus continues, all the Frowns of Conſcience are gone.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All tormenting Fears are baniſhed. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward perplexity, anguiſh and vexation that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed the Soul, through the fear of his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſeparation from the Glory of the preſence of the Majeſty of Heaven, all ceaſe; and there is a bleſſed Calm poſſeſſes the Soul, and then the Soul is brought like a weather-beaten Ship, into the ſweeteſt and moſt commodious Haven of reſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Spirit of Glory poſſeſſeth the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul. Then is its contentment in union and communion with the Lord Jeſus infinite, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, then doth it rejoyce, yea triumph in the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. Thus through this teſtimony unto Senſe, added to the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unto Faith, the Soul is even ſet down with one foot, as it were, into the great City of the King of Heaven, ſweetly expecting his full fruition of that tranſcendent Glory that it ſolaceth it ſelf in the ſweeteſt expectation of, till time ſhall come that Faith and Expectation ſhall ceaſe, and Sight and Viſion ſhall only take place. Thus you ſee what the ſealing-witneſs of the Spirit is unto Senſe. There are now ſome Cautions that of neceſſity muſt be given to you, believing Souls, to prevent any ſad Miſtake about this great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caution.</hi> 1 Firſt therefore you muſt underſtand, That though the fulneſs of the Souls infallible
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:48673:201"/>
certainty of his union with the Lord Jeſus, doth depend upon this atteſtation of the Spirit unto his Faith and Senſe; yet the Lord doth vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe much comfortable evidence to many belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Souls of their certain and infallible union with the Lord Jeſus, to whom he doth not ſend this bleſſed Spirit, thus to avouch and atteſt to their Souls their Union with Chriſt,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Spirit may and doth; by thoſe four former precious effects upon the believing Souls, eſtabliſh their Souls in a ſweet Soul-chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Soul-reviving confidence of the Lords acceptance of them into union with Chriſt. There is the whole Materiality of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits witneſs, of the Souls evidence unto Faith and Senſe, before the Spirits atteſtation unto Faith and Senſe; though the Spirits witneſs is the Formality, as I may call it, its that which gives the being of the Souls evidence both to Faith and to Senſe, yet you muſt obſerve the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the union principally belongs to the Souls Faith,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whatever degree of evidence unto the Souls ſenſe and feeling any ſuch believing Soul doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, before the witneſs of the Spirit unto Faith and Senſe, the witneſs unto Senſe is exceedingly weak, imperfect and unſatisfying to the believing Soul. Now the Soul conceiveth that he doth feel his heart rightly anſwering that precious tender of union, immediately again fearing that that wretched curſed heart of his doth but delude and deceive him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You muſt obſerve, that this comfortable evidence that the Spirit doth vouchſafe to many
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:48673:202"/>
believing Souls, of their union with Chriſt, it is frequently an addition unto Faith only, and to Faith principally. And indeed this is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that the Lord doth vouchſafe thus a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable evidence unto Faith, when his bleſſed pleaſure is to withdraw all evidence of union from the Soul's ſenſe and feeling. This was the caſe of that bleſſed head of all believing Souls, the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.46. Saith he, <hi>My God, My God.</hi> Here was a clear evidence that vouchſafed to the Faith of the Lord Jeſus his certain and infallible union with the bleſſed Father; but the evidence unto Senſe was totally wanting: <hi>Why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. You muſt note alſo, that this comfortable evidence of union with Chriſt, that the Lord doth vouchſafe to many believing Souls, to whom he doth not ſend the Spirit to atteſt their union, is never an evidence to the Senſe of thoſe believing Souls, without an evidence unto their Faith. Though the evidence unto Faith hath no ſuch dependance upon the evidence unto Senſe, but it may conſiſt without it, yet the evidence of union unto the Souls ſenſe, hath an entire and full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon the Souls evidence unto Faith, that it cannot conſiſt without it. The very mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or original of the Souls evidence unto Senſe of his union with Chriſt, is the believing act, the Souls reliance upon the truth and faithfulneſs of the Lord Jeſus to fulfil his bleſſed Word, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reconciliation unto every unlovely Sinner that will. Now without evidence unto Faith of that Souls particular admiſſion into union with the Lord Jeſus, that believing act is
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:48673:202"/>
never drawn forth in the believing Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caution</hi> 2. Secondly, You muſt underſtand, That there is much variety in this teſtimony of the Spirit, both unto Faith and unto Senſe. It doth witneſs in a various manner, to believing Souls their union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is much variety in the Spirits teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unto believing Souls of their union with Chriſt in the full perſpicuity and clearneſs of the Spirits teſtimony. The Spirit ſpeaks both to Faith and unto Senſe, only by a ſecret reſplendent Beam of heavenly Light, and that Beam of heavenly light hath various degrees of Brightneſs, wherein it ſhines in a various manner, unto various belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Souls: To ſome believing Souls that precious Beam of heavenly light ſhines with ſuch an orient tranſcendent brightneſs, with ſuch tranſparent heavenly Glory, that no Curtain of Darkneſs or Diſtruſtfulneſs, or Unbelief, or ſinful Jealouſie, can keep out the virtue of that precious Beam; but to ſome other believing Soul, that precious Beam of Light to Faith, or light to Senſe, ſhines only like a Beam of the Sun through a Key-hole, when the Door remains ſhut ſtill. There is a threefold degree of its clearneſs and perſpicuity, that may be collected from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. where a threefold effect of it is mentioned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is ſuch a teſtimony as procureth reſt and peace to the toſſed, perplexed, believing Soul. That's laid down in the firſt Verſe; <hi>Being juſtified by Faith, we have peace with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond degree, <hi>We rejoyce in hope of the Glory of God.</hi> There is a kind of joy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in the Souls reſt.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:48673:203"/>3. Sometimes the teſtimony is ſo clear and perſpicuous, as it produces a holy triumph and glorying in the believing Soul; <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Not only ſo, but we glory in tribulation alſo.</hi> Yea this ful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity and clearneſs of the Spirits teſtimony, is that which procures ſuch a general Triumph of the Soul, that it doth not only triumph over all external evils, as being more than a conqueror over perſecutions and tribulations; but the heart in that moment alſo triumphs over all temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, even all the evil workings of natural di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt and unbelief in his own Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is alſo a variety in the teſtimony of the Spirit, both unto Faith and Senſe, in regard of the permanency and continuance of the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. To one believing Soul the Spirit bears witneſs of union, by a precious beam of heavenly light ſhining to Faith's eye, and by ſweet holy Rayes caſt upon the Souls believing act, but theſe are but like a flaſh of Lightning, ſhut up again in a moment; but to another believing Soul, the Spirit renders this teſtimony unto Faith, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Senſe, in an abiding way.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a variety in the teſtimony of the Spirit unto believing Souls, in regard of the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of its renewing the ſame Teſtimony. To one believing Soul the Spirit will teſtifie again and again; upon every occaſion, the Spirit will ſtep in very opportunely, when the Soul is at a pinch, and renew its Record; to another believing Soul, to whom the Spirit vouchſafes alſo the ſame Teſtimony, it ſhall be rarely, and for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caution</hi> 3. Thirdly, You muſt underſtand, That
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:48673:203"/>
whenever the bleſſed ſpirit doth avouch and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt moſt fully to a believing ſoul its union with Chriſt, this teſtimony doth not always actually abide in the believing ſoul, without interruption and intermiſſion. This heavenly Light, that the ſpirit of light and wiſdom vouchſafeth to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſoul, may like <hi>Elijah</hi>'s fiery Chariot, mount the ſoul to the third Heavens for a ſeaſon, yet it muſt come down again; though <hi>Paul</hi> be wrapped up into the third Heavens, yet he muſt not abide there while he remains in the fleſh: Though <hi>Peter</hi> might have a ſoul-raviſhing view of the glory of the Lord Jeſus for a ſeaſon in the Mount, yet he muſt not have a Tabernacle there.</p>
               <p>There are four or five reaſons, why it is the bleſſed pleaſure of the Majeſty of Heaven, that the teſtimony ſhould not actually abide in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſoul.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That there might be a difference between Heaven and Earth.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That the Lord might have his honour in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſouls, in his predeſtinated way. The prime and principle way wherein the Lord hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from Eternity, to have honour from his Saints, while they are here below, is from their believing his Majeſty upon his bare word, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That there might be a conſtant, lively, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental ſenſe of the ſouls abſolute dependance upon the Lord ſtill, for the evidence of his union.</p>
               <p n="4">IIII. That the Lord might inſtruct all others the better, by his dealings with ſome believing ſouls.</p>
               <p>God inſtructs weak believers in this, that the evidence of union is not eſſential unto union.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:48673:204" rendition="simple:additions"/>V. That the glory of the precious Saints may be Vailed and hid, and this may be in judgement to the world, that they may ſtumble at the Saints, and judge them diſpicable fools, that ſpend their time in ſadneſs and melancholy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cau.</hi> 4. Fourthly, there is a fourth cauſion, and that is this, that the efficacy of this bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, that the ſpirit gives to a believing ſoul, of his union with Chriſt, ought to continue when the Record it ſelf doth not actually continue. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of the bleſſed ſpirit is the judicial ſentence the ſpirit caſts upon the ſouls final eſtate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be totally definitive, never to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in queſtion by that believing ſoul, but the ſoul for ever after, even in the ſaddeſt interruption of that bleſſed ſpirit ought to ſay, though I do fall, I ſhall ariſe, though I have no viſion of the ſweeteſt face of my Redeemer, yet I ſhall ſee him face to face, when I ſhall be altogether like unto him. It is infinite ſinfulneſs, for that believing ſoul, ever to call in queſtion the love of the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Majeſty of Heaven, after the ſpirit hath thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched it to the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Thus you have heard in ſome meaſure the grand queſtion opened, which is, how a ſoul may certainly and infallibly know, that he is united to the Lord Jeſus. I ſhall now come to anſwer to the ſecond queſtion, which is this;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Que.</hi> 2. How Souls that conceive themſelves to have received certain and ſatiſfying evidence of their union with the Lord Jeſus, may konw certainly and infallibly, that their evidence of this union with Chriſt received is only from God, and not a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Enthuſiaſm, or Inſpiration, or a deluſion
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:48673:204" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by the Divels tranſlation of himſelf into an Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal glory?</p>
               <p>Now for the clearer explication or unfolding this queſtion, there muſt be divers things premiſed.</p>
               <p>There be four things I muſt premiſe concerning thoſe diabolical inſpirations.</p>
               <p>And there are Four things concerning the manner of the Souls trial of his evidence received, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a deluſion, or whether it be from the Lord in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pre.</hi> 1. Firſt, I muſt premiſe, that all the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the implacable malice of the infernal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, is directly ſet a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> work againſt every believers evidence of his union with the Lord Jeſus. The darkning the pretious evidence of the Souls union is in a manner the Center wherein all the Helliſh deſigns that are practiſed againſt a believing ſoul meet together in one.</p>
               <p>All the fiery darts that he ſhoots from his Helliſh Quiver againſt Believing ſouls are intended to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter down the Tower of ſtrong confidence of the Lords acceptance of his Soul into union with the Lord Jeſus. His moſt curſed inſinuations into any believing heart, alluring to any corruption intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally tends towards the darkning the light of the Lords countenance that ſhines upon the believing ſoul; certainly the Devils acting with ſo high a hand againſt the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> that cauſed him to deny his bleſſed Lord and Maſter, the Lord Jeſus, intentionally ended in this, to overthrow his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in Chriſt, and therefore Chriſt tells him, he had prayed for him that his faith fail not. Nay, the bleſſed head of all believing ſouls, the Lord Jeſus himſelf (who was a perfect example and pattern to
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:48673:205" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all believing Souls in temptation) he was encountred withal in this way by the grand Adverſary the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the Devil made his cloſe and ſtrongeſt battery againſt his confidence of the hypoſtatical union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and him; therefore ſaith he, <hi>if thou be the Son of God, command theſe Stones to be made Bread.</hi> And in like manner, all the powers of Hell are in a particular manner employed againſt every Believers evidence of his union with Chriſt, and therefore he eſpecially endeavours to ſtrike down their faith. Whence it was that the Apoſtle was chiefly over the Devil in that particular, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.5. Saith he, <hi>I ſent to know your faith, leaſt by ſome means the Tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.</hi> Indeed there are many reaſons why the peculiar malice of Hell ſhould work in all its ſtrength againſt believers evidence of their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In regard the faith that is neceſſarily drawn forth into exerciſe with ſtrength and power, upon receiving evidence of the ſouls union with Chriſt, is a peculiar object of the Devils malice. And that in Three reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That faith which is drawn forth into exerciſe, is the moſt direct oppoſite of the Devil, it is the Devils grand Adverſary. In that lieth all the ſtrength of the believing ſoul, againſt all the Devils encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: It is the Shield that quenches all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils fiery darts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.6. It is that whereby the ſoul reſiſts the Devil till he gains the conqueſt, and puts that infernal Adverſary to flight, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.9.</p>

                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:48673:205"/>2. In regard it is the moſt triumphant Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror over all his Army, that he calls in for his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance againſt the believing Soul. <hi>This is the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory whereby we overcome the World,</hi> 1 <hi>John.</hi> 5.4. That is, all that either within or without the Soul ſhall concur to the drawing it from obedience to the Lords will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That faith that is neceſſarily drawn out into exerciſe, upon the receiving the evidence of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is that which gives the Lord his moſt peculiar glory and honour of his precious truth: By this the believing Soul ſets to his Seal that God is true, <hi>John.</hi> 3.33. Now the Devils peculiar malice being againſt the bleſſed Majeſty of Heaven, thence his malice is againſt this faith, that is drawn out into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe upon the Souls receiving evidence of union with the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="2">II. In regard the joy and comfort that is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable conſequence of the Souls receiving the evidence of his union, is another peculiar object of the Devils malice. Envy works infinitely in the Devils boſom, upon the ſight of ſuch unſpeakable joy as poor believing Souls are filled with; ſeeing Angels whoſe nature are more glorious, are lef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely deſtitute of joy and comfort. Now from theſe workings of envy, hatred works alſo infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unſpeakably in the Devils boſom, againſt the evidence of the Souls union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The believers evidence of his union with the Lord Jeſus, being the peculiar work of the bleſſed Spirit, of neceſſity muſt be the peculiar object of the Devils malice, there being ſuch a diametrical oppoſition between the Devil, and that bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Every work of that bleſſed Spirit is infinitely
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:48673:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>
abominated by him: And thence this evidence of the Souls union is the particular object of the Devils malice, in regard it is the Office of the bleſſed Spirit to be the comforter of thoſe believing Souls.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. In regard the believing Soul, through that evidence of his union with the Lord Jeſus, hath ſome kind of fruition and enjoyment of Union and Communion with the Father through Chriſt. The Soul doth not only poſſeſs Union and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but hath the knowledge of it, the ſweet and comfort of it, and thats the fruition of Union and Communion. Now the Union of Souls with the Father through Chriſt, is the moſt proper object of all the Devils envie and malice.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The very firſt-born power of his malice works againſt the Believers evidence of his Union, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard Believers through their enjoyment of that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of their Union with Chriſt, do hold forth the moſt orient brightneſs of the Lords grace &amp; love in Chriſt. Now the Lords peculiar delight being in receiving the honour of his love from poor deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble worms; thence the Devils malice works infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the Souls receiving evidence of his union with the Lord Jeſus, becauſe it works infinitely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lords receiving his own intended glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I muſt premiſe, That all the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found policy, ſubtilty, and craft of all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Rulers of the Region of darkneſs, is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in that moſt curſed inſinuation to a believing Soul, that the evidence of his Union with Chriſt, received either to faith or ſenſe, is but a diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal deluſion. The policies of Hell all concur toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:48673:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in its ſtrength in this temptation or inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a believing ſoul that his evidence is but a deluſion.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In regard by the Devils prevailing in this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he leads the Soul in the moſt extricable labyrinth, that there is no poſſibility by all the diligence the ſoul can uſe to evade or eſcape, and find the way out. The Soul once paſſing a Sentence againſt his own evidence, that it is nothing but a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or a helliſh deluſion, he is loſt in a wood as it were of fear and perplexity, of queſtions and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, he is then caught indeed in the Devils thicket, in the bryars that are of Hells own planting. There is nothing then left to clear the Souls way (I mean if the actual evidence of that Souls Union be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended) until a renewed actual evidence of the ſame Spirit comes to the Soul: There is no way left for the Soul wherein it is poſſible for it to make a tryal of his own eſtate; The Soul can make no proof from the light of his own Grace, that light muſt be ſuppoſed to have been diſcovered to the Soul in its union received, that being rejected, no other light can manifeſt Grace to be in the Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">II. In regard the prevailing in this temptation grieves the very Comforter himſelf, it wearies the Spirit of the Lord, whoſe Office is thus; To reveal to the Lord its acceptance into union with Chriſt, it cauſeth the Soul to make a direct oppoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the bleſſed Comforter. So that now in the Devils prevailing in this inſinuation, he no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> only leaves the Soul in a moſt inextricable labyrinth, but provokes the bleſſed Spirit of the Lord to withdraw himſelf, and to withhold all renewed beams of light from that believing Soul.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:48673:207" rendition="simple:additions"/>3. In regard the prevailing of that temptation would bereave the Soul (at leaſt of the fruition and benefit) of all that's paſt over to the Soul in Chriſt. If that temptation take hold upon the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that the Soul draws that concluſion, that his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is a deluſion, then all the boldneſs and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of acceſs to the Throne of Grace for ſupply, is vaniſhed in a moment: In a word, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing of this, the Devil in a manner ſnatches the believing Soul from among the number of the Friends of the Almighty, and ſets him among the poor ſtrangers; by the prevailing of this, he ſnatches the believing Soul from among the Veſſels of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour (I mean in the Souls apprehenſion, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Souls enjoyment) and places it among the Veſſels of diſhonour, it makes the the Soul diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim all intereſt, right and title to any mercy and love.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In regard the prevailing of this inſinuation with the believing Soul, doth reduce or bring back the believing Soul, and make it liable and ſubject to the power and force of all other curſed inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the Devil. The prevailing of this ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on brings the Soul under the force of all thoſe temptations that his Soul was formerly delivered from, all the temptations grounded upon the Souls unworthineſs, all that were grounded upon the Souls long continuance in ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pre.</hi> 3. Thirdly, Every believing Soul that hath received the evidence of his union to faith and ſenſe, muſt expect all the rage, power, and ſtrength that Satan can afford, to be employed againſt the Soul, to darken and obſcure that evidence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All the powet of Hell is employed to ſuggeſt
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:48673:207" rendition="simple:additions"/>
falſe reaſonings, carnal ſenſual arguments into the mind of that believing ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All the power in the corrupted Conſcience of that believing Soul, is and will be employed to accompliſh that deſign, to perſwade the believing Soul that the evidence of his union received, is but a diabolical deluſion. His power in the corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Conſcience will be employed to edifie and ſtir it up to bring in falſe Accuſations againſt the believing Soul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His whole power and ſtrength will be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſtirring up paſſions, and diſordered tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous affections in that believing Soul. Any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving of fear and terror, the Devil will foment and nouriſh, and by his mighty power over thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and affections, make ſuch a confuſion and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, as if the Soul and Hell were to come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther immediately.</p>
               <p>The Devil will employ his power over the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections themſelves, and his power upon the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the Body, through which thoſe paſſions and affections work. The Devil upon the very ſuggeſtion, that the Souls evidence of his union is a deluſion; will exerciſe his power ſo upon the humours of the Body, as to diſpoſe the Body to a timerous trembling, it may be almoſt every joynt ſhaking, upon the imagination it may be deluded, and then nouriſh and augment, by bringing in renewed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation upon accuſation, againſt a believing Soul. So that all the falſe reaſonings of the mind, and the falſe accuſation of the conſcience, hath a more power upon the Soul in regard of the diſpoſition of the body, and the working of the affections.</p>

                  <pb n="400" facs="tcp:48673:208" rendition="simple:additions"/>Fourthly, I muſt premiſe, That all the utmoſt power and poſſibility of corruption that remains in a true Believer, are ready to comply with, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond the Devil in the exerciſe of his malice, policie and power againſt the believing ſoul, to receive that curſed ſuggeſtion of Hell, that his evidence of his union received; is but a deluſion. Wretched Man in his firſt tranſgreſſion joyned a curſed amity with the Devil himſelf, and ever ſince Mans Heart hath ſet at the Devils Councel Table joyning all the ſtrength of its policie and power with that infernal Spirit, to maintain his tyranny over the poor Soul, that whatever Hell-bred deſign the Devil acts againſt the believing Soul, the Heart doth immediately comply with that helliſh deſign; And though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Mans corrupt heart be ready to comply with every motion and inſinuation and ſuggeſtion that proceeds from Hell, yet there is a more peculiar diſpoſition in a believing Soul, to comply with that curſed ſuggeſtion of Hell, that the evidence of his union received is but a deluſion, and that upon theſe Four grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In regard there is a peculiar endeavour of ſenſe in every believing Soul to regain his firſt dominion; to have the prime commanding authority in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Heart. Hence you ſhall obſerve, that the moſt pretious Saints have maintained a mighty battel to the power of their Souls <hi>againſt</hi> ſenſe, ſtriving to prevail over faith; and yet the ſtrongeſt Saints have been inclined and readily diſpoſed to judge of all by ſenſe, that is to judge according to what they ſee and feel of the diſpenſations of God to them, and workings of God in them. So you ſee the holy Man <hi>Gidion, Judg.</hi> 6.12. The Angel of the Lord
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:48673:208" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(which indeed was Jeſus Chriſt himſelf) appeared to him, and ſaid the Lord is with thee thou mighty man of valour: but mark, now ſenſe ſtrives for the dominion over faith; ſaith <hi>Gidion, Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us; and where be all his Miracles which our fathers told us of, ſaying, did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt? But now the Lord hath forſaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the</hi> Midianites. Thus ſenſe ſaith in another caſe, if the Lord will accept me to be one in Chriſt, why is my heart left thus and thus, why are my corruptions thus ſtrong? ſo again you ſhall obſerve, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.2. The godly man <hi>Aſaph</hi> confeſſed that ſenſe did ſo ſtrive for the maſtery, that his ſoul by that had well night loſt its ſtanding in faith; my feet were almoſt gone, my ſteps had well nigh ſlipt; nay ſenſe wrought ſo far that you ſhall obſerve, <hi>v.</hi> 13. the holy man had concluded, that he had cleanſed his heart in vain, and waſhed his hands in innocency. There is a peculiar diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in every believing ſoul, to comply with the ſuggeſtion of Hell; that his evidence of his union with Chriſt received, is but a deluſion. There is a concurrence in this to all the arguments of ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a concurrence with ſenſe, in the cauſe that ſenſe argues againſt the ſoul. Senſes arguments tend all to prove an impoſſibility to forlorn ſouls ſhould be united to the Lord Jeſus: Now this is the very matter of the ſuggeſtion, that the ſoul is not united: ſo that there is ſuch a degree of ſutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that the ſoul is glad of ſuch a ſuggeſtion, as the proof of what ſenſe maintains againſt the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a concurrence in the medium, that ſenſe uſeth to diſprove the ſouls union with Chriſt.
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:48673:209"/>
The grounds of that ſuggeſtion from Hell, that the believing ſouls evidence of his union is but a deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſetched always from ſome defect, or ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage in the believing ſoul, either from ſome want of holineſs, or ſome unſutable working in the ſpirit, to what the ſoul conceives is the temper of the ſpirits of thoſe who receive ſuch evidence of their union: Now Senſes arguments are the ſame; It is always the voice of ſenſe in the believing ſoul, my heart is thus and thus vile; I am dead, vain and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, blockiſh, carnal, ſenſual, ſleighty and looſe, I am little better than a block under Ordinances; therefore it cannot be that I ſhould be united to the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By ſenſes complying with this ſuggeſtion to the believing ſoul, that his evidence of union is but a deluſion: ſenſe doth immediately aſpire to the Throne again in the believing Heart, and doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately endeavour the diſpoſſeſſing of faith. If the heart comply with that ſuggeſtion, that the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his faith is but a deluſion; then ſeeing the ſouls evidence of union was primarily and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally unto faith; faith is made wholly ſubject to the ſouls ſenſe, ſo that ſenſe then bares the prime and principle rule in the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">II. There is a peculiar diſpoſition in a believing ſoul to comply with the ſuggeſtion of Hell, that the evidence of his union with Chriſt is but a deluſion, in regard of that deſperate enmity of carnal reaſon againſt faith in every believing ſoul. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7 <hi>The carnal mind</hi> (which is the ſeat of reaſon) <hi>is enmity againſt God,</hi> ſo againſt all the holy work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God in a ſoul, and therefore in a peculiar manner it is enmity againſt that ſpecial working of
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:48673:209"/>
the ſpirit of God in the ſoul, which is the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſpoſition. There is an irreconciliable oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between carnal reaſon and faith in every ſoul: carnal reaſon cannot comprehend that gracious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable myſtery of the union with the Lord Jeſus through believing only; and becauſe it cannot comprehend it, therefore it is oppoſite to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of his power. Carnal Reaſon is always for ſelf-advancement; and therefore directly oppoſite to the ſouls believing; which is the loweſt debaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſoul; and thence carnal reaſon is oppoſite to the firſt act of faith, and to every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent act of faith alſo; ſo that there could not be a believing act in any ſoul, did not the ſpirit of the Lord come with a mighty power to throw down thoſe ſtrong carnal reaſonings; according to that, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.45. throwing down the ſtrong holds -Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations-Original it is as <hi>Beza</hi> renders it, the very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings of the fleſh are thrown down, whereby the fleſh had fortified it ſelf againſt the ſpirit, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoul to believe. So oppoſite is carnal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to faith, that it invents a multitude of falſe reaſons, and rotten grounds, to perſwade the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate ſoul to a good opinion of his own eſtate, that did not the ſpirit of God throw down thoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, it were impoſſible the ſoul ſhould believe. Likewiſe again after the firſt act of believing carnal reaſon turns the mouth of his great ordnance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it mannages the Battle againſt faith another way: Then carnal reaſon mannages it againſt the right of the ſoul to believe, and perſwades the ſoul it hath not believed, and it may not, it ought not to believe there is no ground for ſuch a diſpicable ſoul as he to believe. Now in regard of this enmity
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:48673:210" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of carnal reaſon in the heart againſt faith, there is a ready diſpoſition in the ſoul to comply with the ſuggeſtion, that his evidence of union with Chriſt is but a deluſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. the evidence is ſutable to carnal reaſon. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reaſon leaps now in the ſoul in its ſuggeſtion, and ſays thus, you ſhould not believe; and yet you would preſume though you were unholy, and altogether unſutable to the promiſe; and now you ſee you have undone your own ſouls, and caſt your ſelves into the inextricable Laborinth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard there is a powerful inclination in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſoul, to comply with carnal reaſon. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reaſon is our own, and becauſe our own, we are willing to put our ſelves under its power.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard there is an oppiniativeneſs in the ſoul of the excellency and ſtrength of the arguings of his own carnal reaſon. This you may obſerve in <hi>Aſaph, Pſal.</hi> 73 16. he confeſſed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedneſs of his own carnal reaſon, when he ſaith, <hi>I thought to know this;</hi> but he confeſſeth when he went into the Sactuary, to conſult with the word of God, and let faith be judge, then he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as ignorant as a very Beaſt.</p>
               <p n="3">III. There is a peculiar diſpoſition in the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul to comply with the evidence of Hell, that his union is but a deluſion; in regard there is ſuch corrupt affections remaining in every belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. Soul in ſome degree, that makes the ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Devil, that his evidence of his union with Chriſt is but a deluſion, to be in a manner plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and pleaſant to the believing Souls. Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and ſuſpitions of God, and his faithfulneſs in r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>iwing ſuch a diſpicable forlorn Soul into u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:48673:210"/>
with Chriſt do in ſome degree poſſeſs every believing Soul; now in regard that ſuggeſtion from Hell, that the Souls evidence of union with Chriſt is but a deluſion, and all the reaſonings of the fleſh that concur with that ſuggeſtion alſo, do nouriſh and increaſe the Souls ſuſpition, and afford matter to the Soul of Jealouſie: thence through the ſtrength of the Souls Jealouſie and Suſpition, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that very ſuggeſtion that under one reſpect is like a dreadful poiſoned Arrow, that ſticks in the Heart to wound the Bowels, yet in another reſpect it is in a manner plauſible and pleaſant.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. There is a peculiar diſpoſition in the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul, to comply with this ſuggeſtion that his evidence is but a deluſion, in regard the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining corruption in the believing Soul doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the mighty power of faith, in crucifying, morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and ſuppreſſing them, by complying with this ſuggeſtion. Faith's power againſt corruption, conſiſts eſpecially in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In holy boldneſs, claiming power from the Majeſty of Heaven againſt corruption, in his holy bold engaging his bleſſed God in Chriſt, to come in for his aſſiſtance. Now this power of faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt corruption is abundantly weakened by the heart complying with that ſuggeſtion from Hell, that the evidence of his union is but a deluſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It conſiſts in faiths holy oratory, in arguing within the ſoul againſt corruption. Indeed there is Faith's mighty power in bringing in ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable arguments, as all the Sophiſtry of Hell it ſelf cannot deviſe an evaſion from them.</p>
               <p>Theſe things I have premiſed concerning delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, only in reference to believing Souls.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that believing Souls might not account it
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:48673:211"/>
ſtrange to meet with that ſuggeſtion, that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of their union with Chriſt is but a deluſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly that Believing Souls might not ſubſcribe ſuddenly to that ſuggeſtion, that the evidence of their union with Chriſt is but a deluſion, without due, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examination of the ground and reaſon that backs and fortifies that ſuggeſtion in the ſoul.</p>
               <p>But now in reference to unbelieving Souls, there is much more to be added ſtill by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe concerning theſe deluſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pre.</hi> 5. Fifthly, I muſt alſo premiſe, that the moſt profound Policie, the depth of ſubtilty and ſuggeſtion of all the Spirits whoſe habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in the Region of Darkneſs is imployed to the utmoſt to delude multitudes of Souls, with falſe hopes, counterfite joys, ſelf-deceiving, and ſoul-deſtroying confidence of their union with the Lord Jeſus, and reconciliation with the Father. Thus the Policy of Hell was imployed to delude thoſe poor <hi>fooliſh Virgins. Mat.</hi> 25.11, 12. by arguing from their profeſſion of the Goſpel of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; (ſignified there by their Lamps) that they were joyned to Jeſus Chriſt, and ſhould be everlaſtingly ſaved by him; whereas poor fooliſh Souls, they ſaw at laſt to their everlaſting horrour and amazement, that they were meerly couzened by the Devils Sophiſtry. Thus certainly the Wits of Hell were imployed to deceive thoſe ſelf-flattering Jews, <hi>John,</hi> 8.18. to make them conceive their natural Birth from <hi>Abraham,</hi> was ground ſufficient, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they ſhould conceive the bleſſed God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be their God: whereas the deareſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate Redeemer of loſt Souls, was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to tell them, they were of the Family of Hell,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:48673:211" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the Devil was their Father. Thus was that proud Phariſee, <hi>Luke.</hi> 18.11. by the ſubtle So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry of the old Serpent deluded alſo; he was even triumphing, as if he were ſure of Heaven, he was thanking God before hand for it.</p>
               <p>But indeed, as it is the Maſter peice of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Policy to perſwade true Believing Souls, that the evidence of their Union with Chriſt is but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion: So on the contrary, the reſult of all thoſe curſed counſels of Hell concerning Unbelieving ſouls, (living under Goſpel Preaching) is to perſwade them that they are certainly joyned to Chriſt, and ſhall be everlaſtingly ſaved by him. And indeed there are Various grounds of this different practice of the Policy of Hell againſt believing and unbelieving ſouls. The Perſwaſion that the ſoul hath, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that his evidence is but a deluſion, is moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for the Devils purpoſe to work upon a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoul.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In regard every believing ſoul is for ever out of conceit with himſelf. Such a view hath every ſuch ſoul received of his loathſome filthineſs, and Forlorneſs, that in ſome degree he doth for ever abhor himſelf, he is utterly out of love with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and all that he is and hath; Now thence it is, the perſwaſion that the evidence of his Union is but a deluſion is ſutable to faſten and take Impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Every believing ſoul hath experimentally found, the dreadful ſelf-Flattery that his ſpirit is exceeding prone to: His heart hath flattered him into a good opinion of his own eſtate, from various rotten grounds: Believing ſoul hath experimental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found, that one time he imagined his eſtate to be
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:48673:212"/>
ſafe, and ſure and ſecure, meerly upon the ground of his own Change and Reformation from what he was; Another time he thought his eſtate to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, meerly from the performance of the duties the Lord required publick and private. Now from theſe many experiences of the ſandy foundations, that his heart had cauſed him to build the hope of his ſecurity and ſafety for eternity upon every belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoul is apt to be Jealous, and ready to entertain any ſcruple about his own eſtate, he is very fearful leaſt he ſhould build upon another ſandy Foundation.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Every believing ſoul hath been ſenſible, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite invaluable worth of Union and Communion with the Lord Jeſus. In matters of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſpirits of Men are naturally ſuſpitious of Diſappointment; So that from the ſence of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite value of Union with Chriſt, naturally flows Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitions and Jealouſies of being deceived in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt matter of Union, And thence the Suggeſtion that the ſouls evidence of Union with Chriſt is but a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion is ſutable and feeds that ſuſpition.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Every believing ſoul is ſenſible of the infinite danger of the loſs of Union, by foſtering falſe Hopes, and groundleſs Conceits of Union, by Flattering himſelf in a good Opinion of his Union with Chriſt, without ſufficient ground from the Lords Bleſſed Word. Now the ſoul apprehending the danger of Miſcarrying is filled with Fear, yea prone to fear where no cauſe of fear is: Every thing makes a man already in fear to be more afraid; Fear clouds the Underſtanding with Darkneſs, and maketh every thing ſeem black and dreadful; So that thence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſouls are ſutable Objects for the Devil to work upon by that Perſwaſion, that the Evidence of their Union is a Deluſion.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="409" facs="tcp:48673:212" rendition="simple:additions"/>V. Every believing ſoul doth prie and ſearch into the Rottenneſs and Unſoundneſs and Hypocriſy of his own Heart, and diſcerns ſome degree both of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundneſs, and Rottenneſs and Hypocriſy. And thence it is that the Devil Imploys his Power againſt the believing ſoul, in regard he hath a foundation, whereupon to build his curſed ſuggeſtions, that the ſoul is deluded.</p>
               <p>Now on the contrary, the depth of the Devils policie is employed to perſwade unbelieving ſouls of their certain reconciliation with God in Chriſt upon theſe grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Becauſe ſelf-flattery hath a high Throne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in every unbelievers heart. There is a curſed Principle of ſelf-love that naturally poſſeſſes every heart, and from thence proceeds this wretched prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ſelf-flattery, a powerful inclination to ſpeak pleaſing things to our own ſouls. Now from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſelf flattery in unbelievers hearts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There proceeds an inward averſion or turning their hearts away from all fears and doubts of their own acceptation of God in Chriſt. It is a Thorn in their ſides, and a Thiſtle in their Eyes, that the Spirit of God ſhould but caſt in a doubt, whether they be joyned to the Lord in Chriſt, or be ſtill in the ſtate of nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the power of ſelf-flattery proceeds al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo an indiſpoſition in every unbelievers heart, to examine the ground whereupon he builds his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and hope of his union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From the power of this ſelf-flattering pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds alſo a readineſs in the heart, to give credit to all vain hopes, and curſed ſuggeſtions from Hell to his unbelieving ſoul. Now in regard of the ſtrength of ſelf-flattering in unbelieving ſouls, as it is back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:48673:213"/>
with theſe three attendants, the depth and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie of Hell is employed to perſwade unbelieving Souls that they are unqueſtionably accepted of God in Chriſt, and ſhall everlaſtingly be ſaved by him.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The depth of the policie of Hell is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unbelieving ſouls, to delude them with falſe hopes of their union with Chriſt, in regard there is a dreadful ſpiritual blindneſs, fallen upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unbelieving ſoul, whereby the Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath his advantage to lead the blind ſoul to thoſe curſed paths of darkneſs.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There is a privative blindneſs fallen upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing ſouls.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A poſitive blindneſs.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There is a privative blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is various.<note place="margin">Privative blindneſs.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. There is an inability in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Soul, to diſcern the nature of the caeleſtial myſtery of a Souls union with the Lord Jeſus. All the things of God are but dark to a Soul, who is under the power of the Prince of darkneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>The God of the World hath blinded the minds of them that believe not.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The natural Man cannot diſcern the things of God, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> But there is a more peculiar blindneſs upon an unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoul, in the myſtery of the Souls union with Chriſt, than in moſt of the things of God beſides, becauſe the myſtery of union with Chriſt hath ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturalneſs in it, and is more contrary to carnal reaſon; Thence it is no great difficulty to perſwade the ſoul, that a falſe groundleſs qualification is the true believing act that the ſpirit of God requires; that this blind confidence is that ſtrength of aſſurance that the Lord commands the ſoul to receive through faith.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="411" facs="tcp:48673:213"/>II. There is ſuch a privative blindneſs in an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſoul, that there is an inability, an inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to diſcern in any degree, the infinite tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent excellency of their ſouls union with Chriſt. The moſt Eagle-eyed carnaliſt that ever proceeded from the loyns of <hi>Adam,</hi> the moſt accurate diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, the moſt deep ſighted politician, never ſaw the leaſt glimpſe of the tranſcendent excellency of a divine union with the Lord Jeſus: likewiſe the multltude of unbelievers, they conceive of union with Chriſt in a carnal way, apprehending that it ſhould ſave them from torment, and that it ſhould bring them to ſome kind of joy, they know not what nor how; Now thence the depth of Satans policie is active in perſwading their ſouls that they are certainly one of Chriſts.</p>
               <p n="3">III. There is ſuch a privative blindneſs in unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſouls, as diſenables them to conceive of the infinite danger of the loſs of union. The multitude of unbelieving ſouls, apprehend nothing but ſome reſtleſs torment that will ſeize upon them in caſe they fail of union with God in Chriſt: Now from their ignorance of the danger of the loſs of union, thence it is that their thoughts are little taken up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their union.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Such a privative blindneſs is fallen upon unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſouls, that there is an inability in their ſouls to diſcern the matter and ground of ſuſpition, that the Lord ſhould not receive their ſouls into union with Chriſt. The ſouls enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and the nature of the enmity is the ground whereupon ſuſpitions are built, that the Lord will not accept their ſouls into union with the Lord Jeſus; Now unbelieving ſouls diſcern not that enmity wherewith their hearts are filled,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:48673:214"/>
gainſt the bleſſed majeſty of Heaven, Thence the policie of Hell is employed to perſwade them, that they are certainly joyned unto the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="5">V. There is ſuch a privative blindneſs fallen upon unbelieving ſouls, as that there is an utter inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in them to diſcern the ground and occaſion of ſuſpition, that their hopes of union with the Lord Jeſus are deluſions. Commonly the experience of that wretched guile and deceitfulneſs, of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt treacherous falſe heart is the original of thoſe ſuſpitions, that their union is but a deluſion; This unbelievers cannot diſcern, and thence it is that the depth of the policie of Hell work againſt unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſouls, in perſwading them of their certain u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Lord Jeſus, when as they are utterly ſtrangers to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Poſitive blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note>Secondly, There is a poſitive blindneſs alſo: That is, a multitude of falſe Principles, and notions of darkneſs, doctrine of Devils poſſeſs the minds of every unbelieving ſoul, commonly unbelievers minds are poſſeſſed with wretched Principles, that ſurely God will damn none of thoſe whom himſelf crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; Or with that Principle, that if Men do what they can, ſurely God will accept them, the Lord will take the will for the deed; Or elſe that Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that ſuch ſtrictneſs, ſeverity and auſterity of life, ſuch a height of holineſs conſtantly in all their ways, is not required of God, men may be ſaved without ſuch ſtrictneſs of holineſs. Now from this poſitive darkneſs there is ſome ſuitableneſs in the ſpirits of unbelieving ſouls to receive that ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, that they are certainly joyned to the Lord Jeſus, and reconciled to the Father when they are ſtill at enmity. That's the ſecond, a dreadful blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is fallen upon unbelieving ſouls.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="413" facs="tcp:48673:214"/>3dly. The policie of Hell works in unbelieving Souls, to perſwade them of their certain union with the Lord Jeſus, in regard every ſeeming counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit ſhadow of holineſs, appears glorious in an unbelieving eye. Every vain empty ſhadow of holineſs, or holy duties, appear very glorious to a Soul under the power of the Prince of darkneſs, whoſe eye the Prince of darkneſs hath blinded through unbelief. There are two principal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why the policie of Hell works againſt unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Souls, to perſwade them that they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly united to the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="1">I. By the prevailing of this ſuggeſtion, unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls are bound with <hi>Adamantine Chains</hi> in the Devils ſlavery.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard the power of all the bleſſed invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the moſt ſweet Soul-melting exhortations unto union, and amity and agreement with God in Chriſt are prevented. The unbelieving Soul then looks upon himſelf as no object of any of thoſe pretious invitations, becauſe he thinks he is already united to the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard the reſtraining power of all the Lords menaces and threatnings to the actings of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is prevented. So that the Soul ſays within it ſelf upon every threatning from the Lords word, that it is not to him, he hopes Jeſus Chriſt hath made peace for him; God and his Soul he hopes are reconciled in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard there is enmity againſt the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and luſtre and beauty of holineſs, excited and ſtirred up in that unbelieving Soul againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations of all thoſe Souls that profeſs union with the Lord Jeſus; who walk in a higher pitch of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, than his Soul walks, in that it eclipſes and
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:48673:215"/>
condemns his life, and vertually Judgeth him ſtill to be a Stranger to the Lord Jeſus, and void of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By the prevailing of this ſuggeſtion with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Souls, they are even devoted unto blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Their Hearts endeavour to expound the truth in a ſuitable way to themſelves; yea, their Hearts work with a kind of infinite enmity againſt every truth that they cannot prevent, that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts their falſe hopes, and ſoul deluding joys.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The depth of the Devils policie againſt unbe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lieving ſouls, is to perſwade them of their certain union with Chriſt, in regard the falſe hopes, the Soul-deluding confidence of ſuch unbelieving Souls, is a moſt mighty means to ſtrengthen the hands of wickedneſs. It is the moſt powerful Orator to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade other unbelieving Souls, to proceed from one degree of wickedneſs to another, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of their wicked Hearts, from their full ſwing in their curſed way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pre.</hi> 6. Sixthly, There is a Sixth Premiſe, and that is this; That the Prince of the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs doth exerciſe a mighty power upon Souls to effect that politick deſign of his, in caſting them into a fools Paradice of imaginary ſpiritual ſafety; in deluding them with vain hopes of union with the Lord Jeſus, when they are Strangers and Enemies to him. This power that the Devil exerciſeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Souls for that end is Threefold.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There is a power that he exerciſeth upon the mind or underſtanding.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A power he exerciſeth upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A power he exerciſeth upon the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or Affections.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="415" facs="tcp:48673:215"/>Firſt, The Devil exerciſeth a mighty power upon the minds and underſtandinngs of Souls,<note place="margin">Satans pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er upon the mind.</note> to delude them concerning their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Lord Jeſus. The underſtanding is to the Soul, as the Compaſs to the Ship, if the Compoſe be marred, the Ship may be eaſily guided into a devouring Gulf, inſtead of a ſafe Harbour. If the underſtanding be once deluded, the Soul may eaſily ſteer his courſe towards the Gulf of everlaſting woe, inſtead of that bleſſed Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of everlaſting happineſs. Thence it is that the Devil exerciſeth a mighty power upon the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings and minds of Souls to corrupt and delude thoſe. Now this power that he exerciſes upon the underſtanding is alſo various.</p>
               <p>There are Eight degrees, or various acts of the Devils power exerciſed upon the minds and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of Souls, to delude them about their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The firſt act of the Devils power upon the underſtanding is his forgery, invention, and ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of falſe reaſons, rotten arguments, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious means, from his high endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Souls of their certain infallible reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or union with God in Chriſt, when they are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated by a braſen Wall of enmity from him. There are Six or Seaven falſe reaſons, and rotten arguments, that he doth ordinarily ſuggeſt unto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Souls, from whence he inſinuates to them faſly their certain union with the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſuggeſts to the underſtandings of ſome Souls, their vaſt difference and diſagreement from other Souls, and thence ſecretly inſinuates to them,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:48673:216"/>
that certainly they are of the number of thoſe that are joyned to the Lord Jeſus. This the Devil ſuggeſted into the mind of the deluded Phariſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.12, 13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Devils ſuggeſts unto ſome other Souls, their enjoyment of ſpecial peculiar priviledges, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the priviledges that the multitude of the World enjoy, and thence alſo inſinuates into them their certain infallible reconciliation to God, and acceptance with him in Chriſt. This the Devil ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to thoſe ſelf-deceived Jews, <hi>John</hi> 8.37, 38. Say they, <hi>we are Abrahams children,</hi> and thence certainly think they, we muſt be Gods Children al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Devil ſuggeſts to ſome other Souls, their moral duties and acts of righteouſneſs, and from thence inſinuates to them, that they are certainly accepted with God in Chriſt. This fallacious ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument was that whereby<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Devil perſwaded the young Man (mentioned <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.20.) that his Eſtate was an Eſtate of ſpiritual ſafety. Thus alſo were thoſe poor blind <hi>Jews</hi> deluded by Satans helliſh ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. They rejected the righteouſneſs that is by Chriſt that was freely tendred to them, upon this ground, that their own righteouſneſs, their outward obſervation of the Law was ſufficient for their juſtification before God, and acceptance with him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Devil ſuggeſts to ſome other Souls, their conſtant diligent uſe of the Lords Ordinances, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for them to worſhip the Lord in. By this kind of falſe argument, did the old Sophiſter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thoſe poor deluded Souls, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.26. Saith they <hi>we have eaten and drunk in thy preſence, and
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:48673:216"/>
thou haſt taught in our Streets;</hi> That is, they had the neareſt communion with him in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, they were diligent hearers of the word, and waited upon him whereever he brought a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuage to them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Devil ſuggeſts to other Souls, their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, and thence inſinuates into them, that ſurely in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in that profeſſion, they ſhall be admitted into union and communion with Jeſus Chriſt, the Lord is at peace with them, their ſtate is good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. This was the very fallacy whereby the Devil deceived thoſe poor fooliſh Virgins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.8, 9, 10. They had Lamps like unto the Lamps of the wiſe Virgins, they had a profeſſion agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſuitable unto the profeſſion of ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and thence they never imagined but their eſtate was ſure enough, till they felt by dreadful experience, that the Lord abhorred ſuch a heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, formal, external profeſſion as theirs was.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Devil ſuggeſts to other Souls, their change and alteration from what they were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and thence inſinuates into them their ſpiritual ſafety, their reconciliation with God in Chriſt. This the Devil did ſuggeſt in ſome degree to <hi>Herod, Mark</hi> 6.20. That his hearing <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> gladly, and his reforming many things, was a certain ground of the goodneſs of his own eſtate.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Devil may and doth ſuggeſt to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Souls, the death of the Lord Jeſus, though ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, brokenly, and confuſedly; and from thence he deceivingly inſinuates into many ſouls, their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and infallible union with Chriſt, when the high Wall of enmity ſtands between Chriſt and them.
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:48673:217" rendition="simple:additions"/>
There is much difference between the bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits inſinuation of the death of Chriſt brought to remembrance, that a Soul ſhall be admitted to the Lord Jeſus, and this inſinuation that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n proceeds from the Prince of darkneſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Devils ſuggeſtion of the death of Chriſt unto Souls, whom he intends to delude with falſe hopes of union with Chriſt; it is only in a general notion and apprehenſion of it. It is a conſtant max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, <hi>Dolus latet in univerſalibus,</hi> that deceit lies under univerſals and generals: Therefore the great Maſter of deceit chiefly endeavours to keep his poor deluded ſouls, in general notions of all the truths of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. Though the Devil ſuggeſts the death of Chriſt unto ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings and minds, whom he intends to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude, yet he avoids the ſuggeſtion of it in any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner, He brings to the ſouls remembrance, that Jeſus Chriſt died for ſinners, but he hides as much as poſſible the quality of ſinners for whom Jeſus Chriſt died, I mean the quality that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Lord from eternity to be effected in thoſe ſinners to whom the death of Jeſus Chriſt is; and ſhall be applied. Commonly the notion is ſo univerſal, they rather think Jeſus Chriſt died for all ſinners; whereas the ſpirit in ſuggeſting the death of Chriſt to any ſoul, ſuggeſts it particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to be for every unlovely ſinner, who ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and accept of the vertue and efficacy of his death, as it is tendered to them; ſo that by its ſuggeſting the death of Chriſt, it begets a holy confidence in the ſoul, of the truth and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Jeſus Chriſt according to the tender of his death, to make up union and communion between
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:48673:217"/>
God and his Soul, and ſo indeed that very act gives the ſoul evidence to his faith of his admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into union.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Devil preſents the death of Chriſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenly, at peecemeals. It may be he minds the Soul that Chriſt died for ſinners, but he brings not one of the precious heart-breaking invitations of Jeſus Chriſt, inviting his forlorn, deſpicable ſoul, to partake of union and communion with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the vertue of his death. Whereas the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſpirit brings the death of Jeſus Chriſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, in a moſt ſweet, pretious, orderly and diſtinct way; It preſents not only the death it ſelf, but it preſents the perſon to whom it is offered, the ſweet heart-breaking invitations to that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſoul to accept that tender.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Devil ſuggeſts the death of Chriſt dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with as much obſcurity as it is poſſible. The Devil ſtudies obſcurity in the preſenting the death of Chriſt to his deluded ſouls, that he might hide and vail that precious heart raviſhing love, that would ſhine forth by a clear view of the death of Chriſt to any loveleſs ſinner. Yea, he ſuggeſts the death of Jeſus Chriſt to the ſinful ſoul ſo darkly, that the very end of the death of Chriſt ſhall not come to the ſouls remembrance, they ſhall never have a thought, that the death of Jeſus Chriſt was on purpoſe to bring their curſed rebellious hearts and God into a ſtate of amity and love again: Should the leaſt ſpark of this Heavenly light break forth, in his ſuggeſting the death of Chriſt, their own Conſciences would ſoon paſs the ſentence of condemnation upon themſelves, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:48673:218"/>
declare them to be farr from any right or poſſeſſion, or intereſt in the death of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Devil ſuggeſts the death of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly, in a diſtracted diſorderly manner, ſo as the ſoule whom he intends to delude, ſhall have no kind of diſtinct orderly knowledge of the death of Chriſt. He ſuggeſts immediately the death of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt for them, and perſwades them with all his power, that Jeſus Chriſt died for them in the firſt place, without any reference to any ground whereupon the Soul ſhould build that perſwaſion: Thence it is that the multitude of your poor delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſouls will tell you immediately they believe, but they know not what they believe, they know no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notion of faith, than to believe that Jeſus Chriſt died for them.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond act of power that the Devil exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth upon the minds and underſtandings of ſouls, to delude them with vain hopes is a diſcerning power into the minds and underſtandings of ſouls. It is one of the principal and grand employments of all the ſpirits in the region of darkneſs to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy mens tempers and diſpoſitions; and mens noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and apprehenſions, that he may obſerve what falſe reaſonings, what rotten Argument is ſuitable to delude that ſoul with, and what rotten argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſuitable to delude another ſoul with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But here is an objection to be anſwered before we proceed: But you will ſay, can the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil look into the underſtandings of men, the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the minds of men, to know what the inward actings of their minds are?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer negatively, that the inward acts of the mind and underſtanding, cannot certainly

and infallibly be diſcerned by all the wiſdom and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie of all the ſpirits in the region of darkneſs, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the inward thoughts and workings of the mind and underſtanding cannot in and by themſelves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately be diſcerned by all the wiſdom of Hell, notwithſtanding their ſtricteſt ſcrutiny. It is the incommunicable property of the bleſſed Majeſty of Heaven to be the ſearcher of the heart, and the knower of the thoughts; Thence in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12, 13. It is attributed to the word of God only, as its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar property, to divide between the joynts and marrow, and ſearch into the ſecrets of the heart. So in 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 4, 5. Chriſt is ſaid in the day of Judgment <hi>to bring to light all the ſecrets of the heart.</hi> But though the Devil cannot diſcern immediately, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, and infallibly, the working of the mind and underſtanding, or the ſecret Thoughts as they are in themſelves and by themſelves, yet the Devil can by other means, have neer gueſs at the moſt inward working of the mind and underſtanding; he can find out the very ſecret workings of the underſtanding in a very probable way.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Devil can diſcern much of the thoughts and different workings of the minds and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of men, by their outward actions. Actions are but the birth of thoughts, as all actions are the births of habits, they are the original of all outward actions that are deliberate and rational. And thence the Devil can diſcern very narrowly into the thoughts by the outward actions, he can gueſs both by the geſture of perſons, and by the very moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the body, what the inward thoughts of the mind are, eſpecially when he diſcerns ſuch and ſuch to be the conſtant way and manner of the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:48673:219" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of a perſon, then he underſtands well what the Principle muſt needs be that leads ſuch a perſon to order his converſation in that manner.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Devil can immediately diſcern what the Images and Species of things are in the fancies of Men. Images of things in the fancy of Man, are but like a ſhadow to the Body; whatever the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and inward motions of the mind and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding are, the images of the ſame things are in the fancy: As the ſhadow accompanies the Body, ſo do theſe fancies accompany the underſtanding; Now the Divel being alſo immediately to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe, from thence he can collect and gather what the notions of the underſtandings are.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Devil can diſcern all the motions of the affections and paſſions. The paſſions always work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the blood, by the motion of the animal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to the heart, and from the heart, thence the Devil can immediately behold the firſt riſe of any paſſion and affection; paſſions of fear, or paſſions of love, or joy, and grief, and hatred and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure: Now theſe paſſions and affections always attending the will of the ſoul, and the will of the ſoul always attending and following the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or the practical Judgment; thence alſo the Devil can collect by the practice and affections, what the inward notions or thoughts and workings of the mind and underſtanding are.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Devil can obſerve diligently what the iſſue and event of his own ſuggeſtions are upon the fancies of Men. He obſerves whatever falſe reaſons that he himſelf propounds do produce <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n the perſon, and from thence alſo he hath a near diſcerning, from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t that he diſcerns, what the workings of the underſtanding and mind are.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="423" facs="tcp:48673:219" rendition="simple:additions"/>5. He hath a large and long time of experience of all the ſeveral and various acts, that various principles, and various thoughts have produced. For though he be not able to diſcern the thoughts while they are locked up in the mind and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, yet afterward, when they are either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by a paſſion, or when they are brought ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently into action, he then underſtands them: Now he for Five thouſand years and above, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring up all obſervations, he hath obſerved when one hath confeſſed theſe and theſe were his thoughts, what the effect of thoſe thoughts were; when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother hath confeſſed theſe and theſe were his thoughts, he hath obſerved what the effect of thoſe thoughts were: Now by his long and conſtant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, he can declare the actions of one Man, with the actions of another Man, what ſuch and ſuch thoughts have produced; and thence can probably conclude, what the workings of the thoughts, and mind and underſtanding of any perſon is: Now in all theſe ways he exerciſes his utmoſt skill, his moſt exquiſite act, to diſcern into the underſtandings and minds of perſons, whom he intends to delude by any falſe reaſonings, concerning the certainty of their union with Chriſt, ſo that the falſe reaſonings that he ſhall ſuggeſt to them may be ſuitable, that they may take at the very firſt ſuggeſting of them. There are three things in the underſtanding, that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to underſtand by all his skill and art.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He endeavours to diſcern the depth or ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs of the mind and underſtanding of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whom he intends to delude by ſome falſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument or other, from whence he would fallaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwade the ſoul of his union with Chriſt. Now
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:48673:220"/>
according to what he diſcerns in the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of perſons, ſo he ſuites his reaſons and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: may be he diſcerns a ſhallowneſs in ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, thence he ſuites his reaſonings pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>portionable to their underſtandings; many poor ſhallow ſouls he can perſwade, that their good meaning is enough to carry them to Heaven: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſhallow ſoul he can perſwade his good Prayers, his deeds of Charity, his paying every Man his own, and dealing juſtly is enough. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when he diſcerns a greater depth of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in any perſon, he lays out more of his curious skill and art, he covers over his falſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons more ſpeciouſly, he lays his fallacy more indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernably and deeply; There is no low Argument that will ſatisfie a deep underſtanding (though a natural one) that he ſhall be ſaved; yea, no lower fallacy will be ſufficient to delude ſuch an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but a falſe apprehenſion and notion about the nature of faith, ſome myſtical fallacy about the myſtery of believing in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Devil ſearches into the notions and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that are moſt ſettled and fixed in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of perſons. There are various notions that every underſtanding is filled with, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the imaginations of the ſeveral perſons are truth: ſome underſtandings are filled only with groſs and carnal, and ſenſual notions, they conceive of God only in a carnal and ſenſual manner, and of the myſtery of the Goſpel carnally; Others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings are filled with notions that have a kind of ſpirituallity in them. Now the Devil makes an exact ſearch to find out theſe, that thereupon he may propound lying arguments, of the union of
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:48673:220" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Souls with Chriſt ſuitable to thoſe notions; So that when he perceives an underſtanding only to be filled with carnal notions of God, he can propound his carnal outſide appearances of worſhipping of God, as a ground to that ſoul of his peace, and union and reconciliation with God, he need ſeek for no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er depth to delude ſuch a Soul; But when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives an underſtanding to be filled with higher no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God, and of the myſtery of the Goſpel, he then propounds not only bare material outward acts of divine worſhip, as the lying ground to delude ſuch a ſoul concerning his union with Jeſus Chriſt, but he propounds inward actings of tranſcient ſlightly affections; yea, may be to ſuch underſtandings, he propounds the death of Chriſt, a ſpeculative faith, and an hiſtorical faith in the death of Jeſus Chriſt, and from this hiſtorical and ſpeculative faith, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates into them their peace and reconciliation with God, and certain ſalvation by the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Devil makes a ſcrutiny into the mind and underſtanding, to diſcern its occaſional notions and apprehenſions upon the providence of God, that the perſon meet with. He pries into the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to diſcern what Judgment it paſſeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lords conferring temporal bleſſings upon it, And he pries into the underſtanding to diſcern what Judgment it paſſes upon the Lords withdrawing temporal bleſſings, and inflicting ſore evils, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ordinary and common conceptions of the underſtanding, upon ſuch providences of God, he may alſo propound his lying arguments of the ſouls union with Chriſt. Thence it is you ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the Devil takes much advantage to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm ſome poor ignorant ones, in their Soul-delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:48673:221" rendition="simple:additions"/>
confidence of their Peace, and Union and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God, from the conſtant influence of all Temporal Bleſſings in their Boſoms: And thence it is, that other ſouls he confirms in their ſoul killing hopes of their Union with Chriſt and Peace with God, from the multitude of Croſſes and Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations they meet withal here below; Thence are thoſe Speeches that you ſhall hear from many Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ones, I hope the Lord looks upon me as his Child becauſe he thus Chaſtiſes me; I hope, ſaith another, that I have my Puniſhment for my Sins here below.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The third Act of Power that the Devil exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth upon the Mind and Underſtanding is this, He doth Secretly, Inwardly, and Indiſcernably Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate theſe his lying Arguments, his Rotten, Falſe reaſons, from whence he falſly inſinuates into ſouls their Union with Chriſt. As the Prince of Darkneſs was a Created Angel, he hath a kind of neer, though mediate aceeſs to the Minds and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings of Men, ſo that he can ſecretly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound all his lying Reaſons, yea he can ſuggeſt them ſo indiſcernably, that the perſon to whom they are ſuggeſted ſhall not Underſtand in the leaſt that they are from the Devil, but ſhall rather conclude they are the right Reaſonings of his own faculty of reaſon that God hath Communicated, or they are the Workings of the Lords Bleſſed ſpirit. Thus the Devil was a lying ſpirit to <hi>Ahab</hi> in the Mouths of the Prophets 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18.23. The way of this neer acceſs of the Devil to the Underſtanding, to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his lying Argument to them of their Union with Chriſt undiſcernably is by theſe two means.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By means of the Subtility of his nature by which he is able to Pierce inſenſibly, and indiſcernably into
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:48673:221"/>
the very Bodies of Men, they neither Seeing, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, nor Feeling that Penetration of <hi>Satan</hi> into their Bodies; So that by this he enters inſenſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very brains of Men, which is the very Organ of the common Senſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He doth both diſcern, and ſtir up and Collect together, the Species and Images of things that are in the inward Senſes, that is to ſay the Fancy, and by moving and ſtirring all thoſe Phantaſms, (thoſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of things that are in the Fancy) he doth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly Convey all his own lying Reaſons into the Mind and Underſtanding, ſo as the perſons to whom thoſe lying Reaſons concerning their Union with Chriſt are ſuggeſted, perceive them not to be from <hi>Satan,</hi> but either imagine they are true Reaſonings from the Word of God, or from the Spirit of God caſt in their Minds.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The Fourth act of Power that the Devil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes upon the Mind is this, That he doth through his Neer and Familiar acceſs through the Fancy to the Mind and Underſtanding, Suggeſt and Propound Frequently and Importunately, his Rotten Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Fallacious grounds of Souls Union with Chriſt. He doth renew again and again the ſame lying Arguments unto Souls, of their Union with Chriſt, ſo as they ſhall ſcarſe paſs out of their Thoughts and Mind; And this indeed hath no ſmall Power upon the Underſtanding, to ſettle the Mind and Underſtanding in a Conceit of the truth of thoſe his lying Arguments. The very Frequency of Thoughts and Imaginations, have the ſecret force of an Argument, to perſwade the Mind that the thing is ſo. You ſhall obſerve it, when any matter runs in our Mind Frequently, Familiarly, and almoſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:48673:222" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we will then eaſily believe there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it. The frequent ſuggeſting of thoſe reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings is a kind of Importuning the mind to conſent to them and embrace them. As that unjuſt Judge, <hi>Luke.</hi> 18.5. condeſcended to the Widow, becauſe of her importunity; (though the juſtice of her cauſe that ſhe propounded bore no ſway in his unjuſt mind) ſo though the reaſon it ſelf at firſt ſuggeſted ſhould bear little ſway; yet the importunity of the Devil in ſuggeſting the reaſon prevails much with the mind to conſent to it and cloſe with it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A fifth act of the Devils power upon the mind and underſtanding is this, that he doth through his accute and clear knowledge of the Images of things together in the fancy, and through his power to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and gather them together in the fancy, ſuggeſt a multitude for his lying arguments, his falſe rotten reaſonings fo the ſouls union with Chriſt, at one and the ſame time. He doth ſo multiply his deluding grounds of the Souls union; that the number of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for the union hath a power upon the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, when the arguments themſelves have little power. The Devil deals with Souls, as he did with Jeſus Chriſt in his tempting of him; he preſented all the glory of the world in the twinkling of an eye, that ſo it might have had ſome perſwaſion in the mind of Chriſt: thus the Devil doth at once ſet almoſt all his rotten reaſons that are ſutable to that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding whom at preſent he is to delude: thus you ſhall obſerve the Phariſee, in that 18. <hi>Luke.</hi> whom the Devil deluded concerning his acceptance with God; he had at once in his thoughts the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that was between him and others, that he was not as other men were; and alſo his exactneſs
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:48673:222" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and ſtrictneſs according to the Lords Law, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tithes of all things, his extraordinary fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency in ſolemn duties, his faſting twice a week; and it is probable, all that ever the Devil could ſay concerning the Souls acceptation with God, was propounded at once to him; ſo that what one rotten lying reaſon want to perſwade the ſoul of his union with Chriſt, another may ſupply.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſixth act of the Devils power upon the underſtanding for this purpoſe is, that he holds and retains the mind and underſtanding, with its full intention and ſtrength, upon thoſe lying ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and rotten reaſons of the ſouls union with Chriſt that he ſuggeſts to him. This the Prince of Darkneſs effects two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">I. By diverting or turning away the mind from all thoſe thoughts that ſhould contradict thoſe ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſons for its union. Now in this Satan doth exeeciſe a three-fold power.</p>
               <p>Firſt he doth excite and ſecretly draw into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, the natural loathneſs, unwillingneſs and indiſpoſedneſs of the mind to any poor holy thoughts ſuggeſted by the bleſſed ſanctified Spirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Satan doth excite the vanity, inſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and wantonneſs of the mind.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Prince of Darkneſs ſtirs up the inward enmity in the mind againſt all ſuch thoughts.</p>
               <p n="2">II. He doth hold and retain the mind upon its lying reaſons for its union; by a conſtant appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of theſe his lying reaions to the mind. So that by theſe two means he doth hold the intention of the mind upon his rotten reaſons, for the ſouls union with the Lord Jeſus, that he prevents the ſouls looking upon any thing that ſhould diſcover its deluded eſtate.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="430" facs="tcp:48673:223" rendition="simple:additions"/>7. The ſeventh act of power upon the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, is this, Satan doth ſuggeſt his lying rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the Souls union with the Lord Jeſus, with a ſuperlative inſinuating power to take the deluded heart with it. Satan doth not only propound the argument and ſo exerciſe a meer moral power u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the mind, but through his power upon the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, he doth immediately ſo inſinuate into the ſoul, that the Soul is prevailed withall to accept of the ſuggeſtion he propounds. Thence you ſhall obſerve in 2. <hi>Theſs.</hi> 2.10. that thoſe that received not the truth with the love of it, were given over to ſtrong deluſions; not only deluſions, but ſuch deluſions as had a prevailing ſtrength in them, to prevail with the mind to believe them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. There is an eight act of power upon the mind and underſtanding, that Satan exerciſeth for this curſed purpoſe. Satan doth ſuggeſt his falſe reaſons and lying arguments for Souls union with Chriſt, with an imperious power, a kind of commanding authority, adding an abſtrenuous, ſetled and fixed affirmation that it is ſo, making up what is wanting in the ſtrength of the argument, with the boldneſs and confidence of his affirmation that it is ſo. By this means he bears down the ſpirits of his deluded ones, ſo as they cannot make reſiſtance, you ſhall obſerve it, a weak ſpirit is overpoured by a ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſpirit, though it be not overpoured by any ſtrength of reaſon, but by the ſtrength of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by the violence and confidence manifeſted in the reaſons and arguments.</p>
               <p>This is the firſt power of Satan to delude ſouls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a power upon their underſtandings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:48673:223"/>
                  <note place="margin">Satans Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er upon the Conſcience</note>Secondly, the ſecond power Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan exerciſeth, is upon the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in Reference to the eſtabliſhing of a poor deluded Soul,, in a ſtrong ſelf-deluding confidence of his union with the Lord Jeſus; that cauſion muſt be always taken, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath not any immediate power to work any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon the conſcience, that's one of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable royal properties of the Majeſty of Heaven; therefore all the power he exerciſes upon the conſcience is but in the corruption and polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of conſcience, his principal power conſiſts in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming thoſe curſed ſparks that are already kindled in the Soul; and indeed he doth make a ſuperaddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a vehemence and violence in every ſuch pollution, as far as the Lord doth ſuffer him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his power. Now there are five of theſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in the Conſcience, that Satan exerciſeth his power upon to delude the poor ſoul.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The injudiciousneſs of conſcience, it's weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in judging, or its blindeſs. Now this injudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of conſcience, is alſo two-fold either the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciouſneſs of the conſcience in reſpect of the rule of judgement, by which it judgeth its union with the Lord Jeſus. Or elſe ſecondly, the injudiciouſneſs of conſcience in the application of the rule</p>
               <p>Firſt the injudiciouſneſs of the conſcience about the rule of judgement by which it judgeth of its uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt now.</p>
               <p n="1">1. from this injudiciouſneſs about the rul, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds thoſe dreadful miſ-underſtandings of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by deluded ſouls. Hence ſuch ſtrange, blind Interpretations of Scripture are given by them, as that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.13. <hi>who ever call upon the name of the
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:48673:224" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lord ſhall be ſaved;</hi> they from hence have conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it was ſufficient for Salvation to ſome kind of Prayers to the Almighty upon ſome occaſions, yea hence ſome have deſperately concluded, that the crying Lord have mercy upon them at the laſt, was ſufficient for Salvation. Yea hence alſo it is, that thoſe deluded ones ſo dreadfully underſtood the command of believing, conceiving it only to be meant of a ſpeculative faith, only a kind of notion, that Chriſt did come down and take fleſh upon him, and did in the nature of man die the death of the Croſs, in ſatisfaction to the Fathers juſtice for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and thence it is ſo common among them, to profeſs themſelves to be Believers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From this injudiciouſneſs in the conſcience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the rule of judgement, proceeds thoſe falſe apprehenſions about the nature of union with Chriſt, or the Souls acceptation of union tendered. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that hearing the word of God, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to make any oppoſition aganiſt it, is the very acceptance of the Goſpel, the very embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that union with Jeſus Chriſt that is tendred to them</p>
               <p>Secondly, The injudiciouſneſs of the conſcience, conſiſts in its injudiciouſneſs in the application of the rule. Sometimes ſuch clear Beams of the Light are darted into a Soul, that the conſcience cannot paſs a falſe judgement upon the rule it ſelf, yet then through the natural corruption of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, through its injudiciouſneſs of, its prone to apply the rule falſely; and this inſudiciouſ-doth Satan exerciſe all his power upon.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="433" facs="tcp:48673:224"/>II. The ſecond Corruption in the Conſcience is the Lazineſs, or Remiſneſs, or Idle Negligence of the Conſcience, in its reſtrayning Office, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it ſhould compel the Soul to fulfil the Will of God that is Revealed to him. The Conſcience is by Divine Appointment a Taſk-Maſter ſet over the Soul, to preſs the Commands of God upon it and inforce Obedience: And through the pollution that overſpreads the Conſcience, it hath been En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined ſtrongly to a remiſneſs in this its Office, to which the Lord hath appointed it; Now the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Exerciſeth all his Power upon this Idleneſs of Conſcience, making it to be more ſtrongly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Careleſneſs and Remiſneſs. And from this Remiſneſs of Conſcience in this its Office.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All the Contradictions in the actings of a Deluded Soul, to the proper natural effect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving true Evidence of a Souls Union with Chriſt are undiſcerned in that Deluded Soul. Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to the Negligence of Conſcience, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining the Soul to do the Will of God Revealed, is the Negligence of Conſcience in receiving an accompt from the Soul, of the Obedience that it hath yielded to the Will of God Revealed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From hence alſo proceeds a quietneſs in the Mind of the Deluded Soul, under all thoſe Sins that are inconſiſtent with Union with the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Were not the Conſcience Remiſs and Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in that his Office, in conſtrayning Souls to Obedience to God, there could be no Quiet or Content in the Mind, while the Soul walks contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Revealed Will of God, eſpecially when his ways are inconſiſtent with injoying Union with God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="434" facs="tcp:48673:225"/>3. From hence the Equity and Rectitude of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> Application of his Lying Arguments for the Union of their Souls, is alſo Maintained Unble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed. The reaſon that remains even in Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Souls, will not be ſatisfied without ſome appearing Equity and Rectitude, in <hi>Satans</hi> Lying Arguments for yielding to it: Now a Multitude of Sins contrary to the natural effects of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving evidence of Union with the Lord Jeſus, would Blemiſh the Equity and ſeeming right Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude of <hi>Satans</hi> application of ſuch a Lying Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Souls Union with Chriſt, yea it would diſcover the falſe application of ſuch a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Argument of his Union.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The third Defilement or Corruption of Conſcience, is its Inſenſibleneſs, or Regardleſneſs, of Sins Committed when diſcerned. This the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Maintains, Foments, and Increaſes with all his Power, in reference to the Deluding the Soul with a fooliſh dream of Union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard hereby <hi>Satan</hi> preſents the Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency and Strictneſs of the Souls enquiring into the nature of his own hopes of Union with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hereby the poſitive ſlightneſs, in the matter of hopes for Union with Chriſt, is Begotten in the Soul. Now this ſlightneſs of Spirit, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their hoping for Union with the Lord Jeſus, doth diſpoſe their poor Fooliſh Souls, readily to receive any ſuggeſtion from Hell that they are Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, without any fear of danger whatever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hereby the Jealouſie of <hi>Satans</hi> ſuggeſtion to the Soul that he is United, is wholly prevented.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="435" facs="tcp:48673:225"/>IV. The fourth Corruption or Defilement of Conſcience, is the Unfaithfulneſs of its Recording or Regiſtring the Souls Iniquities. Now <hi>Satan</hi> exerciſeth this Power upon the Defilement of the Conſcience alſo.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard hereby he doth prevent the Souls whom he Deludeth, from diſcerning or beholding the Contradicting reaſons, to their reaſons from whence they hope that they are United to the Lord Jeſus. Every Sin is a reaſon of mighty weight, to perſwade the Soul that he could never be United, and every Aggravation of thoſe Sins, but above all, the rejecting of Union with Jeſus Chriſt Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: Now <hi>Satan</hi> well underſtanding, that his Fooliſh Suggeſtions unto Souls, that they are Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Lord Jeſus, and his Reaſonleſs Reaſons to perſwade them that they are United, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be admitted of, did the Souls to whom he Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts that they are United, diſcern the Multitude of Reaſons that might perſwade them, it is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that ever they ſhould be United; thence it is he doth exerciſe his utmoſt Power upon the Unfaithfulneſs of Conſcience in Regiſtring the Souls Iniquities, that ſo it may not bring one of thoſe Iniquities to the Souls Remembrance of a Thouſand.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By this Unfaithfulneſs of Conſcience in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtring the Souls Iniquities, the Infiniteneſs and Unſpeakableneſs of the danger of the loſs of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is Undiſcerned alſo by thoſe Souls. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Apprehenſion of Guilt, the greater Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of danger, in caſe the Guilt ſhould not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from their Souls: Now by <hi>Satans</hi> Foſtering up Conſcience in its Unfaithfulneſs, in Regiſtring
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:48673:226" rendition="simple:additions"/>
up the Souls Iniquities, it Apprehends but a ſmall, ſlighty, ſuperficial view of his own Guilt, and therefore hath but ſlighty Thoughts about the loſs of Union, in caſe he be Deprived of it.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The fifth Corruption in the Conſcience, is the Unjuſtneſs in paſſing Sentence upon the Souls Eſtate. Conſcience is ſo Corrupted that it will be paſſing Unjuſt Sentences, Accuſing when it ſhould be Excuſing, and Excuſing when it ſhould be Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing: Now this Unjuſtneſs in the Conſcience in paſſing Sentence upon the Soul, <hi>Satan</hi> exerciſeth all his Power upon, to Augment and Increaſe it to the utmoſt, that by this means Conſcience may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to Comply with any Suggeſtion of his, that the Soul is United; and according to his bare Suggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to paſs the Sentence upon the Souls Final Eſtate, that it ſhall be Everlaſtingly Saved by the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. Thirdly, The third Power that <hi>Satan</hi> exerciſeth upon the Affections, or Paſſions. There is a Two-fold Power that he exerciſeth upon the Affections or Paſſions: There is a Moral Power, and a Phyſical Power.</p>
               <p n="1">I. There is a Moral Power he exerciſeth upon the Affections; that is by propounding Objects ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to ſtir and move thoſe Affections. Thus in propounding to the Soul its certain Acceptance with God in Chriſt, and Everlaſting Salvation by him, he propounds an Object ſutable to move falſe Joy and Delight and Contentment, and ſo by that means heightens the Self-deluding Joying and Rejoycing in thoſe Deluded Souls.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="437" facs="tcp:48673:226" rendition="simple:additions"/>II. There is a Phyſical Power he Excerciſeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Affections; and that is an Immediate Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that he exerciſeth upon the humours of the Body, through which thoſe ſenſible motions of the Will work. It is the property of Affections, to cauſe the blood and the Animal Spirits to move to and fro from the Heart, and thereby to make the Body ſuffer: Now <hi>Satan</hi> can immediately ſtir thoſe humours in the Body, which the Affections do in their workings alſo ſtir, and thence raiſe an Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction beyond its bounds. Now <hi>Satan</hi> exerciſeth theſe two Powers of his upon the Affections.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard hereby the Confidence in Deluded Souls of their Union with the Lord Jeſus, is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned to work with a Mighty Violence, with a kind of Irreſiſtableneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence that Confidence of his Deluded ones, that they are United to the Lord Jeſus, is made Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational. Through the Violent working of ſuch Affections their Judgment is blinded, their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon darkned and obſcured; and when the matter paſſeth to the affections, all Judgment periſheth: then you ſhall have many Deluded Souls, that will hold with much Confidence and Boldneſs the Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they ſhall be ſaved by Jeſus Chyiſt, when they are driven out of all their Reaſons, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they Build this hope that they are United.</p>
               <p>There are now ſecondly, ſome Conſideratios a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Tryal of a Souls Evidence of his Union received, whither it be from God, or whether it be a Diabolical Inſpiration, that are requiſite to be Premiſed before a direct Anſwer to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="438" facs="tcp:48673:227"/>
                  <hi>Pre.</hi> 1. Firſt, that every Believing Soul to whom the Lord hath vouchſafed a clear Evidence of his Union with the Lord Jeſus, is powerfully incited by the Subtility of Hell, to a Dubious, Anxious, Solicitous Tryal and Examination of the Evidence of his Union with the Lord Jeſus Received. The Subtility of Hell works this way in three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In regard the Believing Souls Evidence of his Union with the Lord Jeſus Received is Enervated, made of no force by a Souls Conſent to a Dubious and Anxious Examination of his own Evidence of Union Received. By this means the eye of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiving Soul is off from his Evidence Received, and now he Conceives that his Work and Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that God calls for at preſent from his Soul, is to find out ſome other clear ſatisfying Evidence, of the truth of that his former Evidence, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever light ſhines from the former Evidence is of no Validity to the Soul, unleſs it be backed with ſome other light that ſhines from ſome other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, either in the Soul or without the Soul: So that there is a Bottomleſs Depth of the Subtility of Hell appears in this, he doth ſecretly and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernably deſpoyl the Soul of that Pretious Jewel the Evidence of his Union, while he ſolicits him to a Dubious Tryal.</p>
               <p n="2">II. In regard the believing ſoul is led in a Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Path, to weary his Perplexed ſoul in, wherein all his labour will be in Vain, by conſenting to a doubtful Tryal of his own Evidence of Union with Chriſt received. When the ſoul ſtaggers and wavers in the confidence of the Truth, of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his Union which Chriſt received, and
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:48673:227"/>
proceeds in that timerous trembling wavering manner, to an Examination of that his Evidence, then the ſoul either ſeeks for a higher Evidence than what he received formerly, Or elſe he ſeeks for Infallible Demonſtrations, from the effects of the former Evidence of his Union with Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that that Evidence that he hath received is really from God. Now in caſe the Evidence of the ſouls union with Chriſt that the ſoul hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, were the Evidence from that pretious Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Bleſſed Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, the ſoul ſeeks all in vain to ſeek for a higher Evidence: Or elſe in caſe the ſoul ſeeks to prove certainly and infallibly, that that Evidence of his union with Chriſt that he hath received was from God, by the effect wrought in his own heart, the ſoul alſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in vain, in regard there is a neceſſity that the ſoul muſt be dubious and anxious about the truth of all that he conceives to have received from Jeſus Chriſt, while the ſoul is dubious whether it be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">III. In regard <hi>Satan</hi> indiſcernably gains theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages againſt the believing ſoul by ſolliciting the ſoul to this doubtful tryal of his own Evidence of his union. By <hi>Satan</hi> ſolliciting the ſoul to a doubtful tryal of the Evidence of his union with Chriſt received, he doth indeed appear in <hi>Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Glory, Cloathed with a Glittering Garment of Heavenly Light: He thus beſpeakes the poor believing ſoul; Take heed O Soul thou beeſt not Deluded in this great matter of Eternity, Mens hearts are naturally too ready to preſume, ſaith <hi>Satan,</hi> take heed leaſt thou Befool thy ſelf
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:48673:228"/>
with vain hopes: Thus he ſeemeth to be the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of the bleſſed God to the believing ſoul, ſent on purpoſe to preſs one of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed commands of God unto the Soul, that it ſhould try, examine, and prove it ſelf, only he ſecretly mixeth a curſed principle of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with that precious beam of light; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites the believing Soul to a dubious, anxious trial and examination of the evidence of his union; and ſo conſequently, procures the Soul to reject the bleſſed evidence of his union, that the Lord in the riches of his mercy hath vouchſafed to the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul; whereas the Spirit intends a pretious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving trial, for the Souls more abundant eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment and conſolation, that it may be filled with joy and glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pre.</hi> 2. Secondly, I ſhall premiſe, That the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Soul to whom the Lord hath vouchſafed a clear evidence of his union with the Lord Jeſus, ought not to diminiſh in the leaſt degree his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the Lords will, to accept even his Soul into union with the Lord Jeſus, whilſt he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to try and examine his evidence of union received, whether it be from God, or whether it be a diabolical inſpiration. Sueh is the abſolute neceſſity of the Soul in the trying the evidence of his union with Chriſt, to ſtand faſt in this his confidence, that in ſuch a degree and meaſure as that Soul wavers in this his confidence, in the ſame degree is the Soul uncapable of a right exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the evidence of his union with Chriſt received: So that in caſe the confidence ſhould wholly fail, the Soul is wholly uncapable of a
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:48673:228" rendition="simple:additions"/>
right examination of the evidence of his union with Chriſt. This will appear in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard it is by the acting of this confidence, that the Soul is diſpoſed to receive the clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence unto faith of his union with the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. The Soul is diſpoſed to this two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the acting of this confidence the Eye of the Soul is fixed upon that glaſs, through which the light that evidenceth to the Souls faith, the Lords will to admit him into union with the Lord Jeſus, ſhines. The glaſs wherein the Lord diſcovers his will to admit him, is his word, wherein he declares it is his will to admit every Rebel and Enemy that will, into union with the Lord Jeſus, and into union with himſelf through him. Now the Eye of the believing Soul, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixed and eſtabliſhed upon this bleſſed word of God, through the lively actings of the Souls confidence, becauſe this is the object of his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the object is only in them when there is acting of faith upon the object.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is by the acting of this confidence that a clearneſs is maintained in the Soul, whereby the Soul is ſuitable to diſcern that light that doth evidence unto the Souls faith, the Lords will to admit it into union with the Lord Jeſus. The confidence failing, a multitude of objections and reaſons, this way and that way, ariſe in the ſoul, every one of theſe objections ſcruples and reaſons, is like a Mote in the Eye of the Soul, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents his clear diſcerning of what the light of the bleſſed ſpirit put upon it. Now by the acting of this confidence, thoſe objections, reaſonings, and ſcruplings, are ſilenced and ſuppreſſed, and ſo a
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:48673:229" rendition="simple:additions"/>
precious clearneſs is maintained in the ſoul, a readineſs to diſcern whatever beam of Heavenly light the ſpirit ſhould cauſe to ſhine forth from that pretious word, that it is the Lords will to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it into union with the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When this confidence in the Soul fails, it makes the Soul uncapable for a juſt trial and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the evidence of its union with Chriſt, in regard the acting of this very confidence of the Lords will, to admit the Soul into union with the Lord Jeſus, is the very matter of evidence unto the Souls ſenſe, that it is united actually to the Lord Jeſus. Now when the act of the Souls confidence ceaſeth, then is the very matter from whence the Spirit doth manifeſt to the Souls ſenſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> its union with the Lord Jeſus, taken away. How ſhall the bleſſed Spirit cauſe the believing Soul to ſee its ſelf believing, when there are not the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving actings in the Soul? It is not the habit of any kind of holineſs that the Spirit doth manifeſt to any believing Soul, to be in it ſelf, but it is the acting of any holineſs whatever, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth cauſe the Soul to diſcern in it ſelf, from whence it diſcerns actually its union with the Lord Jeſus: So that then the confidence of the ſoul failing, or ceaſing its actings, the very origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the ſouls evidence unto ſenſe, of his union with the Lord Jeſus, is taken away.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The believing Soul ought not only to forbear the diminiſhing of this his confidence in the Lords will, to admit his Soul into union with the Lord Jeſus, while he proceeds to the trial of his evidence of his union with Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, But he ought alſo to forbear the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:48673:229"/>
of his confidence, that he is actually uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Lord Jeſus already, in caſe the Lord through a clear evidence hath begotten ſuch a precious confidence in the Soul. The believing Soul ought to ſay concerning that his confidence, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaid concerning his, <hi>Job</hi> 27.5. <hi>I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move my integrity from me;</hi> I will not let go this my confidence, till I have proved and examined the evidence of my union with the Lord Jeſus, from whence this confidence did ariſe. This alſo may appear in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard the diminiſhing of this confidence in the believing ſoul, before the trial of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his union with Chriſt received, is an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite injury to the ſweeteſt Comforter, the bleſſed Spirit, who through the manifeſtation unto the Soul that he is united to the Lord Jeſus, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth the Soul in that pretious confidence. The rejecting of that confidence ſo wrought by the bleſſed Spirit, is a ſlighting of the ſpirit in his moſt precious Office, and a diſparagement of the very witneſs of that bleſſed Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a moſt ſinful unconſtancy and fickleneſs, to reject any thing received, before clear demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the errour of the ſoul in receiving. It is contrary to the order rhat the Lord requires, ſhould be in all the motions of the ſoul; which is, that they ſhould be ſubject to the power of holy, ſanctified reaſon: So that this confidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore trial ought to be maintained, in its full ſtrength, in caſe ſuch a confidence was begotten by an evidence formerly received, that he is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally united to the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="444" facs="tcp:48673:230"/>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But here is a queſtion then by the way would be opened. But will the Soul ſay, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then are the commands given by God to prove and examine our ſelves, whether we be in the ſaith, and ſo conſequently to examine the evidence of our union with Chriſt, if we muſt not be dubious and anxious, whether the evidence of our union with Chriſt received be true or no, before we proceed ro the trial and examination of them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. For anſwer to this queſtion by the way briefly. I anſwer firſt, that theſe Commands of Souls examining themſelves whether they be in the faith, are given univerſally to all Souls, on purpoſe that deluded ſouls by the trying and proving themſelves, might diſcover their own deluſions, and diſcern their lying confidence of their acceptance into union with the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe commands are given on purpoſe to believing ſouls, to maintain the life of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the Lords will, to admit them into u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt, and the confidence that they are admitted into union with the Lord Jeſus. Theſe commands are occaſions to Souls truly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to the Lord Jeſus, to review over the grounds of their confidence, of the Lords will to admit them into union with Chriſt, and of the Lords actual admiſſion of them into union. Now the more the Soul views the ground of his confidence, the more it views that bleſſed word of God, that reveals the Lords will to admit even his Soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to union with the Lord Jeſus in caſe he accepts it, and by the Souls gazing upon that bleſſed word, it
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:48673:230" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diſcerns more of the truth and certainty, infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and unchangeableneſs of that word, and the more frequently and fully the Soul diſcerns that, the ſtronger is its confidence in the will of the Lord, that he will admit even that his Soul into union with the Lord Jeſus, and thence there is more occaſion for the bleſſed Spirit to irradiate rhe ſouls believing act, to enable the ſoul to ſee and feel it ſelf to believe aright, by which means the actual confidence of the ſouls admiſſion with Chriſt lives, and is maintained in its ſtrength.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe commands are given that there might be more preparedneſs againſt all aſſaults that are made from Hell againſt thoſe ſouls. Through this examination believing ſouls have their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence maintained in its life and ſtrength, and ſo are fortified againſt temptation, becauſe it diſcerns clearly the foundation upon which his own confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſtands.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Lord gives theſe commands on purpoſe to draw forth into exerciſe, all manner of holy diſpoſitions in the believing ſoul. This is done by the renewed view of that light, that doth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence unto the ſouls faith, or unto the ſouls ſenſe, its union with the Lord Jeſus; Then<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſubjection of the Heart to the will of God in all things acted, then is the correſpondent love of the ſoul, anſwerable to the Lords love to the ſoul drawn out in its ſtrength, then are all the thirſtings after near communion with God in Chriſt acted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pre.</hi> 3. Thirdly, a third thing to be premiſed is this, That there are many ſinful diſtempers incident to believing ſouls in the times when they
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:48673:231"/>
are doubtful of the truth of the evidences of their union with Chriſt, which whenever they do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in any ſoul, during their prevalency, they do incapacitate thoſe ſouls for a juſt trial, and true examination of the evidences of their union. There are eſpecially four of thoſe ſinful diſtempers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident unto believing ſouls at ſuch a time.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is an impatiency and frowardneſs of ſpirit, under the obſcurity of that truth of their evidence of union with the Lord Jeſus, incident to every believing ſoul. Indeed our ſpirits are naturally impatient under every burden, but when any Arrows from the Almighty are ſhot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Conſcience, or any Arrow from Hell ſtick faſt there; I mean any doubtfulneſs, any terrors and fears of the fulneſs of their conceived evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their union with the Lord Jeſus, then are their ſpirits in a ſuperlative manner prone to fret, and vex, and fume, by the prevailing of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly paſſion. Thus <hi>David</hi> under the doubtfulneſs of the Lords fulfilling a promiſe made to him, breaks out into moſt dreadful impatience, in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27.1. <hi>I ſhall one day periſh by the hand of Saul.</hi> So in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.11. <hi>I ſaid in my haſte all men are liars.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.22. <hi>I ſaid in my haſte I am cut off from before thine Eyes.</hi> So the holy man <hi>Job, Chap.</hi> 3.3. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.8, 9. Now during the prevalency of this diſtemper of impatiency and frowardneſs of ſpirit, under doubting the truth of their evidence, their ſpirits are made uncable of a juſt trial and examination of the truth of the evidence of their union with the Lord Jeſus. There are two ways how this ſinful diſtemper doth incapacitate ſouls, for the juſt examination of the evidence of their union.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="447" facs="tcp:48673:231" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. It doth prevent a ſerious deliberate view of the evidences of their union with Chriſt that they have received, by drawing out the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Spirits, to look upon the grounds of their fears of the falſeneſs of the evidence of their Union. When any paſſion prevails in any Spirit, it draws out the whole ſtrength of the Soul that way; Now the intention of the ſoul being drawn out, to look upon the object of his fears, the grounds of his doubts, and the matter of the ſuſpition of the falſeneſs of his union, by this the ſoul is made unſuitable to take any right deliberate view of the evidences of his union.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Impatiency of Spirit under the doubtfulneſs of the truth of the ſouls evidence of his union with Chriſt, doth occaſion every ſeeming oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the truth of the ſouls evidences, to appear greater than it is in its own nature. Thence it is frequent with ſouls under this diſtemper, every ſuggeſtion from Hell bears ſuch weight upon the Spirit, as it is in a fume upon every ſuch ſuggeſtion, conceiving there is abundant argument againſt the truth of his union; whereas upon the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the ſame objection by the ſame ſoul, with a quiet calm ſpirit, thoſe objections appear to be invalid, to have no weight, nor ſcarce any colour, whereby they ſhould manifeſt the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Souls evidence of his union.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond ſinful diſtemper is an irrationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that the Soul ſubjects it ſelf to, in all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions that it draws up againſt it ſelf. Now whenever a believing Soul ſubjects himſelf to this ſinful diſtemper, that he endeavours not to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs every affection of Hope, Fear, or Joy,
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:48673:232" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which is not founded upon ſome bleſſed word of God, then the Soul doth make it ſelf uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of examining and trying juſtly the truth of his own evidences of his Union.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard the Soul will of neceſſity be irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional in all its concluſions. But when the Soul is irrational in its confuſions, it is uncapable of a juſt trial of the evidences of his union, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of comparing that bleſſed golden Rule of the Lord word, and his own evidences toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard the thoughts of the Soul are all diſtracted, when any thing is brought to the thoughts for the truth of his union, that Soul without examination immediately entertains ſome hopes; Again, when any thing is objected to the Soul to prove the falſeneſs of his evidence; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately again the ſoul entertains fears, without examining the reality of what is objected againſt his evidence, and thoſe hopes and fears continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enterchangeably working, make ſuch diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the ſouls thoughts, that it makes it unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable for any deliberate view of the evidences of his union.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third ſinful diſtemper is a raſhneſs, haſtineſs, or ſuddenneſs of ſpirit. Thus ſome doubting of the truth of their former evidences of their union with the Lord Jeſus, becauſe of ſome backſliding from God, that they are conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to themſelves of, will ſuddenly from ſuch a place as that, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. concludes that they have ſinned preſumptuouſly, and that there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing them again by Repentance, or unto Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: The words run thus, <hi>For it is impoſſible</hi>
                  <pb n="449" facs="tcp:48673:232" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for thoſe who were once enlightned and have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of the heavenly gifts, and were made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Holy Ghoſt, and have taſted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come; if they fall away to renew them again unto Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: whereas did thoſe Souls examine the intent of the Holy Ghoſt in theſe words; it were eaſily to diſcern that the Holy Ghoſt intend thoſe who fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally apoſtatize from God, not intending any ſlips and falls, and backſlidings that are incident to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry believing Soul: were there but a juſt examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this portion of the word, by collecting it and comparing with another word that would teſtify ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Saints to have had their fallings and backſlidings, after their taſting of the heavenly gifts, and after their being partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ly in a higher way than the Spirit means here; he mean here by partaking of the Holy Ghoſt, only ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of common gifts of the Spirit: other Scriptures teſtify <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abram</hi> to have had their falls, (yea almoſt every Saint after their taſting of the heavenly gift) and yet to be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again by Repentance Now this diſtemper doth make the ſoul uncapable of a juſt examination of the truth of the evidence of his union with Chriſt 2 ways.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In regard this raſhneſs makes the Soul uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of diſcerning the depths of Satan, whereby he endeavours to obſcure the truth of every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers evidence of his union with Chriſt. This ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful raſhneſs occaſions the Soul only to take a ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial of whatever is ſuggeſted or propounded. Now Satans Suggeſtions have ſome ſparkling of Angelical Glory, ſome verniſh of truth and holineſs, ſo that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuggeſtion of Hell, whilſt the diſtemper of raſhneſs
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:48673:233" rendition="simple:additions"/>
prevails in the ſoul, cannot but be judged a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground to build a doubt and ſcruple upon, and then Satan being always watchful to maintain a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute that he once began with the Soul, to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply againſt whatever can be objected againſt his firſt ſuggeſtion; every of theſe objections of Satan they will be counted ſufficient ground for the raſh Soul to draw another ſafe concluſion, or to ſtrengthen the Soul in the drawing its former falſe concluſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This raſhneſs alſo begets a confuſion in the Soul, the ſoul drawing concluſion upon concluſion, upon every ſeeming ground; and one concluſion maintains contradicting another; a contradition of hope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting a concluſion of fear, and there being no examination (through the domineering power of raſhneſs in the Soul) of the truth of the one and the falſeneſs of the other; theſe concluſions begin to fight in nhe Soul at once, yea multitudes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions ſeem contrary each to other.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Fourth diſtemper that doth incapacitate a Soul for the juſt tryal of the truth of his own e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, is a prejudicial conceit againſt his own evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, even before any examination of the truth of the evidences of his union. This is the ſad diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that prevailed in <hi>Aſaph. Pſal.</hi> 77.2. <hi>my Soul refuſed to be comforted;</hi> he did refuſe to receive any evidence that the Lord would be faithful. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this was the diſtemper of the Church, <hi>Lamen.</hi> 3.17, 18. Thou haſt remove my Soul far off from peace, I forgot proſperity; (or rather as it is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by ſome, I forgot God) it is moſt probable ſhe refuſed to entertain any of thoſe thoughts, that the Lord would yet be gracious. Hence it is, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Souls under the Power of this diſtemper; do
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:48673:233" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtudy to wind themſelves from under the Power of any truth that ſhould lay hold upon their hearts, ſo as to anſwer their objections and cavils againſt their acceptance into union with the Lord Jeſus. Now this Diſtemper doth make Souls uncapable (while it prevail) of a juſt examination of the truth of their own exidences, in regard it cauſeth ſlighty, unworthy thoughts of their own union.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pre.</hi> 4. Fourthly it is to be conſidered, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any Soul is declined from, or decayed in his former activity and operation of holineſs, he is then unſutable to examine and to try juſtly the truth of his own evidence of his union with Chriſt. He is unſutable in theſe five reſpects,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard the light of manifeſtation from the ſpirit is always ſuſpended when the heart is in this decaying temper in holineſs. When ever any heart decay in holineſs, his firſt original decay is in the activity and ſtrength of the precious believing diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the will, to cloſe with and accept of the precious tender of the Lord Jeſus to the Soul; now when the Spirits light of manifeſtation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it doth irradiate the word to the Soul is withdrawn; the Soul muſt needs be uncapable to examine the truth of his own evidences, for it is only through the Spirits irradiation or manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the word, that any believing Soul doth at firſt clearly and ſatisfyingly, and unqueſtionably diſcern the Lords will to accept his Soul into u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Lord Jeſus, and therefore when this Light of manifeſtation from the Spirit is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn again, it cannot be that the believing Soul ſhould clearly diſcern their precious truth; and ſo long as the Soul enjoy not this evidence unto his ſaith of his certain acceptance of union
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:48673:234" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with Chriſt: it is impoſſible the Soul ſhould have any evidence unto ſenſe, ſeeing the evidence unto ſenſe doth wholly depend upon the evidence unto faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard all the oppoſite powers of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in his Soul, unto the Souls evidence of union with Chriſt, do renew in ſome degree their Tyrranny over the Soul. Yea, not only ſo, but all the powers of corruption that do oppoſe the Souls union with Chriſt, are then furniſhed with renewed arguments and objections againſt the poor Souls acceptance into union, yea with ſuch objections as nothing can anſwer but ſaith it ſelf. As for example;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then carnal Reaſons' mouth is filled with new matter of objection againſt the Souls union. Carnal Reaſon, that ſaid formerly, thou art a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, an Enemy that have continued thus many years in enmity, therefore cannot be admitted into union with the Lord Jeſus, can now ſay more; thou haſt now dealt unfaithfully with God; thou art an Hypocrite, a Bacſtſlider; it is impoſſible that the Lord that bore thy enmity and rebellion, ſhould bare thy falſeneſs and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Natural Diſtruſt of God, curſed Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and Suſpitions of the Faithfulneſs of God, do renew their Tyranny alſo, when Holineſs decay. Now natural Diſtruſt, and curſed Jelou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy of God can ſay, what doſt thou think it is poſſible for the Majeſty of Heaven, who is ſo juſt; who hath ſaid he will avenge himſelf upon thoſe that go on in their wickedneſs, ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver accept the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> into reconciliation with himſelf?</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="453" facs="tcp:48673:234"/>3. The corrupt Conſcience renews his Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing Power when the Soul decay in Holineſs Now Conſcience is furniſhed with a new Bill of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment againſt the Soul; it can now lay to the Souls charge, guile and deceitfulneſs of heart with God, and willing Apoſtacy from God, ſo that now it can with a full mouth paſs the ſentence of Condemnation againſt the Soul afreſh, and is furniſhed with ſuch arguments, as nothing but Faith can anſwer; nothing but a renewed viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords will declared in his bleſſed word, to accept of every poor, undone periſhing Soul, be he as bad as an incarnate Devil, (in caſe the Soul will accept of union with him) can ſatisfy either carnal reaſon, or ſuſpitious argmments, or conſciences accuſations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Soul decaying in Holineſs; is unſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to examine the evidence of his union, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Soul remain under an inevitable, an unavoidable neceſſity to ſubmit to the Judgement that Senſe ſhall paſs upon his Soul. Now Senſe can paſs no other Judgemennt upon a Souls e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate that is decayed in Holineſs; but that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the evidences of his union with the Lord Jeſus that he conceive he had received, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions. Senſe can ſee none of thoſe precious inſeparable effects of a Souls evidence of union with Chriſt, and ſenſe can paſs no other Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unleſs it be captivated unto the power of Faith.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In regard there is apparent defect in ſuch a Soul of the proper inſeparable effects of the true manifeſtation to a Soul, that it is united to the Lord Jeſus. The inſeparable effects of an
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:48673:235"/>
evidence unto a Soul, that it is united to the Lord Jeſus, is an heighth of Holineſs: now when Holineſs is decayed, Satan can ſay by a fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous argument, thy evidences of thy union that thou thoughteſt thou hadſt, are deluſions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: doſt not ſee by the effects of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, thoſe that have evidences of their union with Chriſt, have their hearts in an adoring, admiring frame of God, they have their hearts enlarged to the utmoſt towards God in Chriſt; but thou haſt a blockiſh, ſenſeleſe, careleſs, heartleſs, mindleſs, unprofitable Spirit; ſurely, thy evidences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are deluſions. Now indeed here is a falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Satans arguments, that is hard to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; here is a depth of Satan; here is one of thoſe cunning devices that moſt Souls are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of; He fails of nothing in his argument, but only in time: His arguments ſhould have run thus; only Souls that have true evidence of their union with Chriſt, whilſt thoſe evidences remain; they are in an admiring adoring frame, and their hearts elivated and enlarged in all kind of Holineſs: If this had been Satans major pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, his aſſumption muſt have been falſe; then he could not have ſaid, but thou in that moment and inſtant, when thoſe evidennes were given to the during the continuance of thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences in their clear light, that thou wert uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, thy heart was not enlarged in all kind of Holineſs, and taken with a precious admiration of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In regard the Soul is under an actual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the Lord, to a penal ſuſpenſion of
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:48673:235" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all kind of manifeſtation unto the Soul, either that the Lord would admit him into union with Chriſt, or that he is admitted. The Soul he can never diſcern the truth of his own evidence ſatisfyingly and infallibly, without the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame light, both manifeſting the word to the believing diſpoſition, and manifeſting the believing act alſo to the Souls apprehenſion: Now therefore the Soul muſt needs be unſutable to examine the truth of his evidence of union with Chriſt, while he is actually provoking the Lord to withdraw that bleſſed Spirit, and to ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pend his operations unto the Soul.</p>
               <p>Now here is a queſtion neceſſarily caſt in, to be opened by the way, before we can proceed any farther.</p>
               <p>Que. But will the Soul ſay, if Souls under the dominion of impatiency, raſhneſs, irrational affections, prejudicial conceits againſt the truth of the evidence of their union with Chriſt, and Souls under decays of Holineſs, be unſutable for a right tryal of their evidences; then what ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table means remain for ſuch Souls, under fear that the evidences of their union are deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>
               <p>Anſ. Firſt, I anſwer, that the only immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate effectual, means of redemption of ſuch Souls, from ſuch torturing fears, ſuſpitions and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, that the evidences of their union with Chriſt are but deluſions, is a renewed act of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in the truth of the Lords word to their particular Souls, wherein the Lord doth declare his will, to give the Lord Jeſus freely, to every
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:48673:236"/>
periſhing Sinner that ſhall accept him, to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate a reconciliation with the Father for him, though plunged into the moſt bottomleſs depth of Sin.</p>
               <p>The Univerſal, Unlimitted Offer of the Lord Jeſus, to every particular, periſhing and loſt Soul, that will accept it, is the prime foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all the righteous hopes, that ever dwelt in a believing Soul: all the expecttations and hopes of believing Souls, are but the building upon that foundation; now when the building of the Souls hope ſhake, the only means to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the building, is to add ſtrength to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
               <p>This you ſhall obſerve was the remedy of the poor diſtreſſed Church, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.40. after many diſtractions in her ſpirit, many toſſings and tumblings, this way and that way, when ſhe had fed upon gaul and wormwood for a long time, at laſt ſhe was conſtrained to take this courſe, to ſearch and trie her ways, and turn again to the Lord; ſhe was conſtrained now to make a new converting work of the matter; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as Chriſt tells his Diſciples, except ye be converted, (when they were already converted) that is, unleſs you renew the cloſe of your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits with me, whereby you may have power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this particular ſin: and I conceive this alſo may be intended by the ſpirit of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. in that ſweet councel to poor diſtreſſed ſouls in this caſe, that walk in darkneſs, and hath no light, that is, no refreſhment, no comforting hope, to truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God. Here is firſt a renewed act of Faith,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:48673:236" rendition="simple:additions"/>
immediately commanded to ſuch a diſtreſſed ſoul, let him truſt in the name of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Secondly, here is a direct act of Faith, an act of Faith proper to the ſoul, that did never put forth a believing act formerly. Here is an act of Faith required and commanded to be done by theſe ſouls, without reſpect to any thing in themſelves, without reſpect to their former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, whether they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> be true or falſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to their receiving grace, whether they have received grace, or not received grace. It is worth the clearing, that this ſhould be the only immediate means, to deliver ſuch declined ſouls from under the fears, that the evidences of their union with Chriſt are but deluſions. This will appear in three things,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard it is in this renewed act only, that the former evidences and manifeſtations given to ſuch ſouls of their union with Chriſt, do ſhine forth in their perſpicuity, clearneſs and ſatisfying power,</p>
               <p>Then only when the ſoul doth thus cloſe afreſh, with that union with the Lord Jeſus offered to it, there is both light within, and light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, whereby the ſoul is able to diſcern the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer manifeſtation unto the ſoul, of its union with the Lord Jeſus in their glory and power afreſh.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard through this renewed act only, the proper effects of evidence of union with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, are again ſtirred up and drawn forth into their powerful operation. Now it is the ſouls apprehenſion of the want of thoſe precious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, that evidences of union with Chriſt do na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally beget in believing ſouls, that do occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the poor diſtreſſed ſoul to ſuſpect his own evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:48673:237" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and to be Jealous they are but deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now the only means to deliver theſe dark and doubtful ſouls, from under the Tyrannical Power of theſe Jealouſies and Suſpitions, muſt be this renewed believing act, this renewed confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in that truth of the Lords word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he tender Chriſt in general to every ſinner, in regard theſe bleſſed effects, the evidence of union with Chriſt do naturally beget in ſouls, are only made viſible to theſe believing ſouls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by that means.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard both the incapacity of ſouls for the tryal of their evidences, and the unſutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſouls for tryal alſo, are removed by that renewed believing act, in regard thoſe diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers are healed. Theſe are healed two ways.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By a more general influence of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly by a more particular influence.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By a more general inffuence of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving act into thoſe diſtempers. The believing Soul cloſes with the Lord Jeſus tendered, ſo as he accept of a redemption from his ſin, and from under the power of corruption through Chriſt: the notion under which the Lord makes the prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of Chriſt unto ſinners, is that he ſhould me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate a reconciliation, between the Father and the ſoul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall ſo accept him that he ſhould beget a precious amity between the Fether and the Soul; eſtabliſh the ſoul in a ſtate of love, that is, the ſoul as well to be filled with love towards the Lord, as the Lord to be filled with love towards the Soul: Now in a ſouls accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Jeſus Chriſt thus tendered, the ſoul ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:48673:237" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Chriſt neceſſarily as a Redeemer, to redeem him from ſlavery under thoſe Enemies of the Majeſty of Heaven, even Sin and Satan, ſo that there muſt be a State of Amity and Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the Soul.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this particular act, hath a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar influence into thoſe particular diſtempers, that made the Soul uncapable for a juſt exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the evidence of his union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In this renewed belieeving act formerly mentioned, there is a precious, ſweet act of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in the will of the believing Soul, to the will of God. Indeed the believing act is the higheſt ſubmiſſion to the Lord, that ever is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by any Soul to him, in regard the Soul in that caſe captivateth all his reaſon and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only to the Lords authority, becauſe the Lord hath ſpoken ſo, and ſo concerning his Soul. Now from hence, this renewed, believing act, hath a precious influence into the diſtempered Soul under impatiency, to heal the impatiency of the ſpirit that domeneerd in him, for now the will is contented to wait on God, it is contented the will of God ſhould be fulfilled in him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This believing act hath a particular influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence into the Souls raſhneſs to heal that diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per alſo. In this renewed act, there is a renewed ſenſe of the believing Souls abſolute nothingneſs: Now from the Souls actual ſenſe of his own no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingneſs, proceeds a holy awe, a holy reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial fear of the Majeſty of Heaven, which doth hold in bounds the raſh, diſorderly Spirit, ſo that by this the Spirit is more carefull how it draw concluſions from any precious word of God.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="460" facs="tcp:48673:238" rendition="simple:additions"/>3. The believing act hath an influence upon the diſorderly affections; the irrational affections which did alſo incapacitate believing Souls for a juſt examination of their evidences. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Soul doth captivate all the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and thoughts of ſenſe and carnal reaſon, unto the truth and authority of God, and ſo all the diſorderly affections, jealouſies, doubts and fears, are even captivated and brought under.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This renewed, believing act hath an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence alſo into the prejudicial conceits, or opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the evidence of union received, to ſubdue thoſe. In the believing act there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed ſight of the truth of the ſouls former e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence unto his Faith, of his union with Chriſt in ſome degree; ſo that the ſoul while he was under the power of his fears, that the evidence of his union were deluſions, having loſt the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying power of the manifeſting light unto his faith, that he ſhould be accepted into union with Chriſt, doth now again in this renewed act gain a ſight and manifeſtation of that ſatisfying power in a manifeſting truth that his Soul ſhould be acepted into union with the Lord Jeſus: Now thence the Lord diſcerns the cauſeleſneſs of his own prejudicial thoughts, and opinions of his former evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences unto faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo conſequently abhor himſelf, in that he diſhonoured the bleſſed work of the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Through the vertue and efficacy of this belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving act that decay in holineſs, which did make the ſoul unſutable to take a juſt impartial tryal of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of his union with Chriſt are repaired, that appears in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The mind of the believing ſoul is filled with all
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:48673:238"/>
the notions, conceptions and apprehenſions from whence Holy Actings do ariſe; are Maintained and Increaſed, and through the defect of which, Holineſs Decays and Conſumes in any Soul. Theſe Holy No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from whence Holineſs proceeds, are principally theſe; That there is a fulneſs of all Love and Mercy, tendred freely by God to this Poor Unlovely ſoul, that the Lord is ſo infinitely rich in his love, that he doth paſs over all that can be ſutable for the poor em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty Soul, freely to it in Chriſt. Now it is impoſſible there ſhould be a Renewed Believing act, without theſe Notions being brought freſh to the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Believing Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All the Holy Affections are excited alſo to a Renewed exerciſe by vertue of the Renewed Act. All the Affections are under the command of theſe two, <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hatred:</hi> Now both theſe are excited to a Renewed Exerciſe, and that with a Mighty ſtrength. by vertue of the Renewed Act. Love towards God is nothing but the very refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of the Lords love caſt upon the ſoul, upon God again: The actings of love always proceed, from the Apprehenſions of the Lords love to the Soul; Now in the Believing Act, there is an actual view, of the infinite unſpeakable Riches of Love, to the Unlovely, Forlorn Soul, and thence Love is drawn forth in its very ſtrength towards God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Likewiſe Hatred, which command the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the Affections, is nothing elſe but the Diſplicency tha is in the Will againſt any object whatever, which affections do naturally proceed from the ſouls love: Now therefore the hatred of the ſoul is properly againſt Sin, and whatever is contrary to God and his Will. In the ſame degree that Love
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:48673:239"/>
acts in the ſoul towards God, in the ſame degree doth hatred work towards every thing that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God: Now by the ſtirring up of theſe two, all the other Holy Affections alſo are excited into their exerciſe; thence the decays of Holineſs are ſweetly repaired, and the ſoul put into a ſutable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the tryal of his own Evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Secondly I anſwer, That all the Lords Ordinances and Appointments, for his peoples ſouls to injoy Communion with himſelf in, are alſo medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and ſecond means of the delivery of thoſe ſouls from the dreadful Tyranny of the Fear and Jealouſie, that the Evidences of their union are Deluſions. Thus Prayer, Conference, Meditation, hearing the Word, are all ſecondary means to wait for the ſpirit to breath in power from the Lord Jeſus; to enable the ſoul in this Renewed Believing Act, and to continue the Believing Act in the ſoul. So that you ſee a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient means left for theſe Diſtempred or Declined ſouls, that are either Uncapable or Unſutable, for a juſt examination of the Evidence of their Union, to deliver them from Fear and Terrour, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of their Union with Chriſt Received are Deluſions. Now in Regard the queſtion is about a matter ſo practical, I ſhall therefore turn the laſt Anſwer into a kind of Adviſe, Beſeeching and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating every Diſtempered, or Declined ſoul in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, to take this courſe, to ſtrive for deliverance of his ſoul from under the power of his Tormenting Fears, that the Evidences of his union with Chriſt are Deluſions: And for that end I deſire you would take theſe four Directions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 1. Firſt that you forbear for a little ſeaſon, the Trial and Examination of your own Evidence
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:48673:239" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with the Lord ceaſe a little to Plead your Title with the Lord; Spend not all your thoughts about what Evidence you have Received, as though there were no good to be expected, except your former Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences were real.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 2. Secondly let me adviſe you to take a ſtrict accompt of your own hearts, of all your fears, and all the grounds of your ſuſpitions, whereupon you ſuſpect that your evidences where deluſions: gather together and ſum up all hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie and falſeneſs, the unconſtancy, the looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the vanity, the raſhneſs, the blindneſs, that's now brought to your remembrance, to prove your evidences received were but meer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions; gather together all the defects, of thoſe precious effects of real evidence from God to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſoul of its union with Chriſt, that you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend your ſouls want; and further ſuppoſe them all to be true, take all for a little ſeaſon for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſuppoſe that your heart was falſe, and that you were wholly and altogether an Hypocrite, that all the workings of your ſpirit were nothing but common workings of the bleſſed ſpirit. But, then</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 3. Thirdly ſearch the holy records, the Lords bleſſed word for all the diſcriptions of thoſe to whom union with Jeſus Chriſt is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tendered, and find out whether thy ſoul ſuppoſed to be in the eſtate fore-named be excluded from the number of thoſe to whom union with Jeſus Chriſt is freely tendred. Search from Scripture whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou canſt find any one Hypocrite, any one captivated ſoul, by the Devils deluding reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, any one falſe hearted treacherous wretch,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:48673:240" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ever excluded from the number of thoſe, to whom the Lord freely offers union with the Lord Jeſus; ſearch whither any loſt Soul, any Rebel, whether any rational Creature to whom the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Jeſus Chriſt comes, be exclured from the number of thoſe to whom the Lord freely offers union with the Lord Jeſus: ſtrive beſeech you now to gain that clear apprehenſion, that ſo at laſt thou maiſt baffle the Devil in all his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſilence him in one word; ſaying, well though I have been falſe to the bleſſed Majeſty of Heaven all this time, though I be now under thy curſed power, O Satan, though thou holdſt me faſt in thy curſed Chains of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet thou maiſt ſay, the bleſſed Majeſty of Heaven, he that can never lye, tells me that union with the Lord Jeſus, and ſo Redemption from thy curſed ſlavery is freely offered to my Soul ſtill; the Lord tells me his will admits me to be ſtill one; with Chriſt, if I can be contented that he ſhould mediate a reconciliation between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and me.</p>
               <p>Direct. 4. Fuorthly, Plead with thy oppoſite contrary mind, to make thy heart conſent to the bleſſed word of God, wherein he doth offer u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Jeſus Chriſt, and himſelf through Chriſt, to every Soul that ſhall accept him. Gaze a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again upon the bleſſed tender; ſay to thy unbelieving mind; O my crooked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing mind. Wilt thou not conſent to the truth of yonder Majeſty of Heaven, yonder God of truth it ſelf that cannot lye; ſay O my ſoul if thou wilt accept yonder union with the Lord Jeſus, behold what tranſcendent glory thy ſoul ſhall be filled with;
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:48673:240"/>
                  <hi>O my Soul wilt not thou truſt to the truth and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Lord, when he makes ſuch an offer, wil't not be content to ſubject all thy reaſons, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Arguments to his Authority?</hi> Still ſtrive again; ſay, <hi>O my Heart, though thou haſt been an Hypocrite, though the Devil hath couzened thee theſe many years, though thou haſt dealt falſly with the Lord all this time, yet the tranſcendent love of yonder God ceaſes not to work towards thee, O take up thy reſt O my Soul, credit the Lord upon his word, and wait O my Soul for the fulfilling of his word to thee.</hi> This is the prime, effectual, infallible means of the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of your poor perplexed tortured Souls, by the tyranny of fear that your evidences are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions; And this is the never failing means of diſcovering to your poor dark obſcure ſouls, the truth and reality of theſe your evidences, that your Souls cannot diſcern. Truly Souls of all the directions that ever I commended to you, I muſt ſet a <hi>probatum eſt</hi> upon this remedy; It is a tried one Soul, it is an approved one, an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced one; I beſeech you follow it: Let your Souls be held no longer poring upon your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer evidences, as though you had no ſpring of refreſhment but in thoſe: Suppoſe your Heart to be as bad, as the Devil poſſibly can make it, yet ſtrive with your unbelieving Mind and Heart to accept anew of union tendered to your poor, loſt, periſhing Souls in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pre.</hi> 5. In the fifth place I ſhall further pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe this, That an impartial, juſt, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous examination of the evidences that any ſoul hath received of his union with the Lord Jeſus,
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:48673:241"/>
can only be taken while thoſe evidences remain in their perſpicuity, clearneſs, and ſatisfying power. The evidences of a Souls union with Chriſt, being only precious, orient beams of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly light, ſent forth from the bleſſed ſpirit of light into the obſcure Soul, joyned alſo with a precious exciting power, ſent forth from the ſame Spirit to ſtir up the light inherent in the ſame Soul too, while the evidence is gone, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be that any Soul receiving ſuch evidences; ſhould juſtly try, weigh, examine, and prove the reality of thoſe evidences, no longer than thoſe evidences do continue. There muſt be light without, and light within, to enable a Soul to make an examination of any thing: And both the light without, and the light within, being the evidence it ſelf to the ſoul of its union, thence it is there is a neceſſity of the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be proſecuted or followed, only while the Soul enjoys thoſe evidences in their bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, clearneſs, and ſatisfying power. The evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the Souls union, are beams of Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly light, ſent down from the Father of light, on purpoſe to bear teſtimony to a Soul of union with the Lord Jeſus: And thence indeed it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that theſe Witneſſes ſhould be heard ſpeak for themſelves, before any trial of the truth and reality of their teſtimony can be made by any Soul; Now theſe Witneſſes never ſpeak for themſelves, but while they are actually bearing Witneſs; that is, while thoſe precious beams of Heavenly light, do actually ſhine into the obſcure ſoul; Now when once thoſe beams of light are withdrawn, the ſoul is now in queſtion whether
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:48673:241" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Lords will be, to admit his Soul into union with Jeſus Chriſt or no. Now that thoſe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous examinations of the evidences of union, can be only taken while the evidences do thus continue actually in the ſoul, this I conceive may be collected from <hi>John</hi> 7.17. <hi>If any man will do his will, he ſhall know nf the Doctrine, whether is be of God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelf.</hi> The words are an Anſwer to a queſtion that the <hi>Jews</hi> propounded to Jeſus Chriſt, or they are a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention to a Queſtion that the <hi>Jews</hi> might have propounded: Chriſt had affirmed, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that he taught, was not his own, but his Fathers that ſent him, <hi>v.</hi> 16. Now it might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected: But how can you prove that your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is your Fathers, and not your own? How will you manifeſt it to thoſe that deny your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be divine, that it is Divine? Chriſt anſwers, <hi>If any Man will do his will, he ſhall know of the Doctrine whether it be of God;</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, whoſoevers Heart ſhall be in a precious readineſs, actually to obey my Fathers will, he ſhall actually know the Doctrine whether it be of God. So that two Propoſitions are laid down in the words; the one expreſly, the other implicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The firſt is affirmed by Chriſt, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of the truth and divinity of pretious Goſpel truths, is only peculiar to obedient Souls.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is implicitly affirmed, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſoul is diſobedient to the Fathers bleſſed will, cannot (during his diſobedience) diſcern truth, divinity, and infallibility of Goſpel Truth: Now thence may be collected, that believing
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:48673:242"/>
ſouls do enjoy the ſpirit of diſcerning, in their way of obedience, and do beſt and moſt perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly and clearly underſtand the Lords bleſſed will, and ſee the reality of every truth of the Goſpel, and the infallibility and certainty of its coming from God. Now mark, then only believing ſouls do yield obedience to the Fathers will, and do actually obey Goſpel truth, when their ſouls receive through believing ſome evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, at leaſt in ſome degree, that the Lord will receive their ſouls into union with himſelf in Chriſt, through their believing in him. Every believing act is but the conſent of the believers heart, to the truth of what the word bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of; which is in effect, nothing but a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers receiving the evidencing light of the bleſſed word, that the Lord will admit his ſoul into u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with himſelf in the Lord Jeſus, in his accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him; So that the believing ſoul being then only obedient to the will of the Father (in the prime way of obedience which is Faith) when he is receiving ſome evidence of his union with the Lord Jeſus, thence it appears, that a juſt and impartial, a righteous examination of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, that the ſoul hath received of his union with the Lord Jeſus, can only be taken, while thoſe evidences do actually continue in their clearneſs and power. For the further clearing of this, take theſe two reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In regard then only the ſoul is ſutably diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take the examination. That will appear in divers particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is only then when the Evidence unto a ſoul of his union do actually remain, that the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:48673:242"/>
of the ſoul is enlightned by the bleſſed ſpirit, and inabled to conceive of, and to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend aright, any truth from the bleſſed Word of God propounded to him. Even when the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the ſoul is renewed, and ſome preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous beam of Heavenly Light Communicated to the poor ſoul, (ſo that in a Metaphorical Sence, the blind ſoul became a ſeeing ſoul? yet there is a neceſſity alſo that the ſame ſpirit, that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the ſeeing eye to the underſtanding, ſhould alſo Communicate the ſeeing of the eye; It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the ſame ſpirit that Communicated the Habit, ſhould Communicate alſo the Act; the ſame ſpirit that gave a Principle of Divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to the ſoul, muſt alſo act the ſame Principle of Spiritual Knowledge, to make the ſoul actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know, or underſtand any Spiritual, Holy My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery aright; Now then, when the Evidences to the ſoul of its union with the Lord Jeſus actually remains, then is the mind and underſtanding of the ſoul thus actuated by the Bleſſed Spirit, then is the Principle of Holy Knowledge drawn forth into exerciſe, ſo that the mind is then inabled to diſcern into the Myſtery of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, thence it appears, that the ſoul can only then take a Righteous Examination of the Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his union.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard it is then only, that the ſoul is Conquerer over the natural Enmity of the Mind, that oppoſe the Minds, conſent to the truth that doth evidence unto the ſoul its union. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Mind is Enmity againſt God; Now in the ſame degree the believing ſoul remains unregenerate, enmity ſtill poſſeſſes the believing mind, and then
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:48673:243"/>
only hath the Believer conqueſt over thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of enmity that poſſeſs the mind, when he hath actual evidence of his union with the Lord Jeſus; now it is only then when the enmity of the mind againſt God is brought into captivity to the Law of faith, that the Soul is ſuitable to take the examination of the truth of his own e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of his union with Chriſt, in regard the mind now is diſpoſed to accept or agree unto thoſe truths of the Goſpel, from whence the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth manifeſt unto the ſoul its union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard it is then only, that the Soul under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands and believes what the true Celeſtial Star is, from whence thoſe beams of light, that do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally come from Gods evidence unto a Soul, his union with Chriſt muſt flow and ariſe. The pretious word of the ever-living God to every loſt ſinner, declaring that his will is to admit every of thoſe Souls that will, to be reconciled to himſelf in Chriſt, is that precious, bright, orient Star, from whence thoſe beautiful beams of light, that do or may diſcover unto a ſoul, his union with Chriſt muſt ariſe: Now it is then only; when the beams of light ſhine from the Word perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and clearly unto a ſoul, declaring his will to admit of reconciliation with them through the Lord Jeſus, that they underſtand and believe this to be the true Heavenly Star, from whence the light that evidences unto them their union muſt flow.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In regard It is then only, that the irreſiſtible power; that thoſe precious beams of light con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in them (that do evidence unto any ſoul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:48673:243" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from God its union with Chriſt) is ready to take impreſſion upon the heart. The irreſiſtible power that the beams of light contain in them, is the Authority of the bleſſed Majeſty of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. They are nothing but the diſcovery unto the Soul that the Lord hath ſpoken it, that it is his will to receive the ſoul into union with Chriſt. Now this irreſiſtible power of theſe beams of light, only take impreſſion upon the Heart, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the lively actings of holineſs in the heart; And the lively actings of holineſs in the heart, are only according to the degree of light the ſoul enjoys, diſcovering unto it the Lords will, to receive him into union with the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: So that when thoſe beams of Heavenly light ſhine moſt clearly in the moſt tranſcendent beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then is the heart filled with the moſt lively, holy actings, then do love, and fear, and joy, and delight, working their power and ſtrength; And therefore it is only that the Authority of God ſpeaking, or declaring any thing to the ſoul, take the deepeſt impreſſion upon the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In regard the believing diſpoſition in the will of the ſoul, is only then in exerciſe in its power and ſtrength. The prime evidence unto a ſoul of his union, hath been diſcovered to you, to be only an evidence unto faith, and in like manner the prime demonſtration of the truth of that evidence, muſt be a demonſtration given to faith only: Reaſon muſt not aſpire ſo high to be the Judge of faiths action; Still it muſt be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther act of faith, that muſt paſs a ſecurity upon the former act of faith: So that thence when the
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:48673:244" rendition="simple:additions"/>
believing diſpoſition infuſed into the will of the believing ſoul is ſtrongeſt in exerciſe, then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the ſoul ſuitable to take a righteous exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the evidences of his union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is only then when the evidences of the ſouls union with Chriſt are clear and perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that it is ſuitable to take examination of his evidences rightly, in regard of the evidences themſelves, which then only appears in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſelf-diſcovering glory. It is the inſeparable property of thoſe beams of Heavenly light, that ſhine from the word of God, to diſcover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves really to be from God, even by their own native luſtre and glory: Thoſe beams of light come forth with the name of God written upon their foreheads; ſo that the believing ſoul no ſooner beholds them, but he reads the name of God written upon them; now this their native ſelf-diſcovering glory, never appears to the ſoul, but when theſe beams of light actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the ſoul, in their perſpicuity and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and therefore when the ſpirit ſuſpends its influences, then the ſoul cannot behold thoſe beams of light what they are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> There is another Queſtion that here inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth it ſelf, which muſt of neceſſity be anſwered.</p>
               <p>Believing ſouls will now reply in this manner, If an impartial examination of any ſouls eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his union with the Lord Jeſus, can be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken while the ſplendor and brightneſs of his evidences remain in the ſoul; then what uſe ſhould ſouls make of the evidences they conceive they had received of their union with Jeſus Chriſt, when the luſtre and orient brightneſs of their evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences be eclipſed, and their commanding power
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:48673:244"/>
enervated or wounded, that their evidences ceaſe to witneſs unto them their union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In order to the ſatisfaction of ſouls in this ſcruple, we ſhall lay down divers Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. Firſt, whenever the celeſtial glory of thoſe pretious beams of light, that the Lord vouchſafes to caſt into any believing ſoul, to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence his union with Jeſus Chriſt, be dark, and thoſe invincible and impregnable demonſtrations, that the bleſſed ſpirit gives unto the ſouls faith, to prove and demonſtrate its union with Chriſt be weakned, yet it is then doleful weakneſs; yea, abhorred wickedneſs in any ſoul, to caſt off all confidence of the Lords admiſſion of his ſoul into union with Jeſus Chriſt. Though the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory light of the bleſſed ſpirit, or the ſuperadded light to the word, that cauſes the word to give ſo clear and ſatisfying a teſtimony unto faith, of its union with Jeſus Chriſt be withdrawn and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended yet there is a Heavenly ſhining, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lamp of the written word of God, that ſtands conſtantly ſhining to diſcover to the faith of the believing ſoul, the open boſome of the love of the Lord Jeſus, and his outſtretched Arms ready to graſp the ſoul into the neareſt union: Therefore it muſt needs be dreadful hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid wickedneſs, for any ſoul to neglect, ſlight, undervalue, or diſregard the light of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious written word, becauſe thoſe Heavenly beams of ſuperadded light that the ſpirit ſometimes gives are by the wiſdom of the Lord, or through the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the ſouls own iniquity ſometimes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended. The Command of believing ſtands as an everlaſting command founded and built upon the meer written word, making a pretious diſcovery
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:48673:245" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Lords will to admit every loſt, periſhing ſoul that will, to be reconciled, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23. Now thence it is moſt wretched diſobedience in any ſoul, when he hath loſt that glorious light of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation from the ſpirit, to diſobey that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Heavenly command alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. Secondly, Whenever any ſoul ſubjects himſelf to the Principle of darkneſs and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that ſtill dwells in him, upon the Lords with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing the brightneſs and glory, of that ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying light of the ſpirit, that did evidence unto the ſoul his union with Chriſt, and caſt off his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the Lords admiſſion of his ſoul into union with Chriſt, then the ſoul is uncapable while he ſo remains of making any pretious, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe of thoſe former evidences that his Soul en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed of his union with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard while the ſoul ſo remains, there can be no holy conception of the evidences that his Soul did formerly enjoy. Firſt take holineſs for all kind of ſtrictneſs and righteouſneſs, and conformity to the Lords bleſſed will, and in that ſenſe there can be no righteous conception of his former evidences; The ſoul cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them what they are, nor diſcern them as they were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Take holineſs, effectively, for theſe conceptions that do excite and quicken a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoul unto holy actings, and in that ſenſe there can be no holy conception of his former eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, while the ſoul ſo remains: All ſuch concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or apprehenſions of the way of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, are as holy effectively, that is, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce or quicken a ſoul to holineſs, are ſuch as do
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:48673:245"/>
apprehend ſome beam of excellency ſhining forth from thoſe ways of God, in relation to that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſouls good; now while a ſoul caſts off all his confidence of the Lords will, to admit him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to union with the Lord Jeſus, he cannot conceive of his former evidence in ſuch a manner, as to conceive any beam of excellency ſhining forth from God, in relation to his particular ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. While any Heart ſo remains, he is uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of making a holy uſe of his former evidences, in regard the activity of all holy affections what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever depend upon the activity of that believing diſpoſition, they live and die together. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Principles that move holy affections obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, are the believing conceptions and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of God; that is to ſay, the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Lords will, to receive the poor love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſoul to be reconciled to him, through his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Jeſus Chriſt: And therefore while a ſoul caſts off all his confidence, that the Lords will is to admit his ſoul to be one with Jeſus Chriſt, there is a defect of moving Principles, to move the affections to their exerciſe; and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there can be no activity of any pretious, holy affections.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard all the Ordinances, that ſhould excite and quicken the heart, to the holy uſe of his former evidences, are made uſeleſs. While the ſoul enſlaves himſelf to carnal reaſon through unbelief, not believing Gods will to make him one with Jeſus Chriſt, though the Goſpel ſhould be preached by the mouth of Angels, and they ſhould be ſent from Heaven to be mouths to thoſe ſouls in Prayer, yet thoſe Ordinances could have

no operation upon thoſe ſouls; ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. The word that was preached profited not, becauſe it was not mixed with faith in them that heard it: if there be not ſome degree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in that great and grand Goſpel-truth to the particular ſoul, there can be no mixing faith with any other Goſpel-truth that ſhould be Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo as to make it have a pretious efficacy upon the Heart.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When any Heart yields up himſelf captive to unbelieving reaſon, and ſo caſts off all that his pretious confidence, it cannot make a believing uſe of his former evidence of union with Chriſt, in regard there is a continual decreaſe in all holineſs, and encreaſe in all the working of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, while the ſoul ſo remains. The Heart is ſo naturally active, that it will be ſpending its ſtrength in ſome kind of activity or other, and therefore when the holy actings of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named precious confidence is ſealed, the Heart will ſpend all its ſtrength in corrupt workings; when the Heavenly plant of faith doth not grow and flouriſh in the ſoul, the weeds that come from the Devils Garden will be all flouriſhing, hardneſs, indiſpoſition for God, hard thoughts of God will all be augmenting daily.</p>

                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. Thirdly, No Soul ought to entertain ſuch a ſuperlative conceit of the uſe of thoſe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of his union with Chriſt, that he formerly received, that he ſhould make thoſe his evidences the ſole, or the primary, or the principal Prop or Pillar, whereupon he builds his confidence, that the Lord will admit his ſoul into union with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. The utmoſt uſe intended by God,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:48673:246" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that believing ſouls ſhould make of former evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences received, can be but ſtrengthnings and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, to renew the ſtrength of their confidence in his truth and faithfulneſs, to fulfil his bleſſed word unto their ſouls, It is utterly ſtrange from the mind of God, that ſouls ſhould make any one act of God towards or in the ſoul the principal Pillar, Rock and foundation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to build its hope of his union with Jeſus Chriſt. All thoſe actings of the ſpirit of God, whether by way of light and manifeſtation, or by way of infuſion of holineſs, they are meerly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary (excepting only the ſpirits conſtant influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for the preſervation of the life of a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoul) and conſequently, changeable and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, according as the infinite wiſdom of Heaven doth ſee ſuitable, for the eſtate of various ſouls: but now the Lord out of that tranſcendent riches of his love in Chriſt, hath prepared unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rocks, where the prime Anchor of believing ſouls hope ſhould be faſtned, unmoving Pillars that never ſhake, whereupon the foundation of their confidence muſt be laid, according to <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17. he confirms it by an Oath, that by 2. immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, two things that were ſubject to no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration or diminution, that is to ſay, by the word of the Majeſty of Heaven, and by his Oath alſo, they might have ſtrong conſolation, that do flee from refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; that is, that do accept of the Lord Jeſus tendred to them: So that the hanging thus the eternal eſtate of the ſoul upon the former evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, is too high an uſe to put the former evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences too: It is the truth it ſelf that the former
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:48673:247"/>
evidencing beams of light manifeſt, that is only deſtinated to that pretious uſe, to build the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the ſouls admiſſion into union with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt upon, even that truth that the Lord doth declare, that it is his will to admit even that particular ſoul into union with Jeſus Chriſt, if he will aceept it; and whenever ſcruples and objections and doubts poſſeſs the ſoul concerning the truth of any former evidences, the firſt-born of the ſouls endeavour ſhould be taken up, in in clearing that truth that the ſoul did conceive ſome beams of light did evidence to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 4. There is a ſtrait command from the higheſt Majeſty of Heaven and Earth, given unto every believing ſoul, to make a holy uſe, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and improvement of his former evidences of his union with Jeſus Chriſt vouchſafed to him. That one Scripture gives ſufficient teſtimony, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.32. <hi>Call to remembrance the former days, in which after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions:</hi> This the Apoſtle commands them in order to the ſtrengthning of their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>ver.</hi> 35. Thus <hi>Aſaph</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.5, 6. When he was under darkneſs, when the powers of unbelief began to rage in his ſoul, and to tyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize over him, then he began to make improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his former evidences of the Lords love, and favour to him, he remembred God, and was troubled; now he recalls himſelf, and begins to make diligent ſearch into the former teſtimony of the Lords kindneſs to him, <hi>I conſidered the days of old, the years of ancient times, I call to remembrance my Song in the Night, I commune with mine own Heart, and my Spirit made diligent ſearch. I call
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:48673:247"/>
to remembrance my Song in the Night;</hi>] that is, the former comfortable Communion I enjoyed in God; how God delighted himſelf in Communion with my ſoul, and my ſoul delighted it ſelf in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God again, how God ſpake peace to me, and I anſwerably rejoyced in God again: <hi>And I Commune with mine own Heart</hi>] I looked over the Records of my Heart, and made diligent ſearch, to ſee what experience of truth, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and loving kindneſs of God to my ſoul are treaſured up there. Yea, then to help himſelf further, <hi>ver.</hi> 10.11. he endeavours to make ſome improvement of the manifeſtation of the Lords love and kindneſs, truth and faithfulneſs even to others; <hi>I will remember the works of the Lord, ſurely</hi> I <hi>will remember thy wonders of old.</hi> There is a command from Heaven upon believing ſouls to make uſe of their former evidences, and there is ſome kind of inherent power in every believing Soul to act ſomething in order to this holy uſe, or improvement of his former evidence. Now the holy uſe of thoſe former evidences, that believing ſouls are engaged from Heaven to make, they are various. We ſhall endeavour to ſum up 5. or 6.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Every ſuch ſoul ought to gather from his former evidences of his union with Jeſus Chriſt, ſome ſtrength to his preſent confidence, that the Lord will admit his ſoul into union with Chriſt. I beſeech you miſtake not, I ſpeak not of thoſe probable fluctuating hopes, that ſome ſouls have enjoyed of their union with Jeſus Chriſt, from ſome apprehenſions of ſome preſent actings of the Holy ſpirit in their Hearts, to clear to them in ſome degree their union with Jeſus Chriſt, and to foſter up ſome hopes of it, Thoſe I ſay, though
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:48673:248"/>
they may be, and are frequently ſuch as really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt; yet alſo from ſuch conceited, and ſuppoſed actings of the ſanctifying ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt, proceeds moſt of thoſe ſoul-deluding hopes, that poor blind ſouls are deluded with, by the Prince of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And therefore becauſe the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two, is a matter of ſo great difficulty to diſcern, I durſt not perſwade any ſoul who conceives that he hath had evidences of his union with Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe evidences have been on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome flaſhes of light, from ſome conceived act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the ſanctifying Spirit of Chriſt, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve firmly, impregnably, and unmoveably, that the truth and reality of thoſe his evidences did deſcend from God, when he doth not diſcern them: Thoſe fluctuating evidences unto ſenſe, queſtionleſs if Souls adhere unto them, they muſt put them upon the tryal by ſenſe again. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now obſerve, I ſpeak of the pretious, clear, infallible evidence given unto a believing ſoul, from the bleſſed Spirit of light and manifeſtation, to clear unto the Souls faith unqueſtionably, that the Lords good will is to admit his particular Soul into union with Jeſus Chriſt, in caſe his Soul will accept it; through which evidence unto faith alſo, the evidence unto ſenſe hath attained a clear beam from the Spirit of light, diſcerning the truth of the cloſe of the believers Heart with the bleſſed will of God; yet mark alſo, that which I ſpeak hath its relation ſolely to thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videncing beams of light given unto the believers faith of his union with Jeſus Chriſt. Now I ſay, though ſuch a ſoul be unſuitable to take a juſt
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:48673:248"/>
examination of thoſe evidencing beams of light formerly given to his faith, when their glory is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured and darkned, yet the Soul ought to believe the truth of thoſe evidencing beams of light, though it cannot ſo clearly and ſenſibly diſcern it. The matter that was evidenced to the Soul, is no more than that there lies an Obligation upon the Soul from Heaven continually to believe; And therefore the matter that was evidenced being true, and the Soul engaged from God to believe it, the Soul alſo ſtands engaged to believe the truth of that his former evidence that his Soul received, concerning the bleſſed will of God towards him; and from the remembrance of ſuch a former ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manifeſtation, given unto the Soul by the bleſſed Spirit, concerning that bleſſed good will of God towards him, the Soul ought to gather heart and ſtrength, and courage to renew the confidence of his poor, wavering, rrembling, unſtable Heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The believing Soul ought from the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his former evidences, given unto his faith of his union with the Lord Jeſus, to foſter and nouriſh a lively hope in his ſoul, that the ſame bleſſed light of manifeſtation (to manifeſt unto his faith clearly his union with the Lord Jeſus) may return. That experience that ſuch a Soul have had, that there is a time of light, and a time of darkneſs that the wiſdom of Heaven ſeeth ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for believing Souls, that there is a Night and a Day, as well in the Spiritual life, as in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural life, ought to be a ground to maintain a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope, that when it is Night, Day may break, and therefore it is his Duty unqueſtionably to nouriſh and cheriſh ſuch a lively hope.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="482" facs="tcp:48673:249" rendition="simple:additions"/>3. From the remembrance of its former evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the Soul ought to obſtruct it ſelf in the obſcurity, darkneſs, and dreadful blindneſs of his own mind. The believing Soul ought to ſay within himſelf; <hi>O when the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt irradiated the bleſſed word of God; how clear, how unqueſtionable was it to my Soul, that it was the Lords bleſſed will to receive my Soul into union with Jeſus Chriſt, if I will embrace him; and though I have now the ſame word to teſtifie the ſame thing to my Soul, yet how dark is it to my Soul for the preſent, how hard is it for my poor blind Mind to receive and apprehend, that the Lords will is to receive this my Soul into union with Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. From the remembrance of the Souls former evidence, the Soul ought to inſtruct it ſelf in the myſtery of the Lords way towards believing Souls. From hence the Soul may learn, that the Lord carries on the Soul towards full Communion with himſelf through Chriſt, as well by ſenſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays in Communion, as by ſenſible encreaſes in Communion; And from thence the Soul might inſtruct it ſelf, that joy and peace, raviſhment of Spirit, triumphing acts of faith, are not ſo inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from believing Souls, but that they may be wanting, that they are not abſolutely neceſſary to be conſtant, at leaſt to the Souls attaining unto perfection of Communion; ſo that thus the Soul may learn to adore the Lord in apprehending the unſearchableneſs of his ways, even towards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Souls, the unſearchableneſs of his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that neither Man nor Angel can mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="483" facs="tcp:48673:249"/>5. From the remembrance of the Souls former evidences, whoſe brightneſs and glory is now ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed, the Soul may inſtruct it ſelf in the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity of an intire, conſtant, uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dependance upon Jeſus Chriſt for the Spirit of light and manifeſtation: The Soul ought in remembrance of that full ſatisfaction that it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed when that bleſſed Spirit of light gave beams of light to his dark mind, to clear up the will of God revealed in his precious word; to ſay, <hi>O how infinite is the neceſſity of hanging upon Jeſus Chriſt continually, for the conſtant operation of the Spirit of light into this my dark Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. From the remembrance of the Souls for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer evidence of his union with Jeſus Chriſt, the Soul ought to collect holy Pleas, and pretious Arguments, to intercede with the Majeſty of Heaven for the return of the bleſſed Spirit of light and manifeſtation unto his Soul. This was the conſtant practice of all the Saints, who had enjoyed any experiences of the Lords mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and kindneſs, they did endeavour to engage the Lord to return when he ſeemed to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>Many are the Arguments that a believing ſoul may collect from the former enjoyment of eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of union with Chriſt, to plead with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Heaven, to return with the ſame ſpirit of light and manifeſtation again to his Soul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the remembrance of the Souls former evidence, the ſoul may remember the pretious ſuitable diſpoſition, that poſſeſſed his Heart for the worſhipping of the Lord in every Ordinance.
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:48673:250"/>
Now from thence the Soul may raiſe a pretious Argument, wherewith he may go boldly to the Throne of Grace, and cry to the bleſſed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Heaven, <hi>when ſhall that bleſſed Spirit of light return to this darkned Soul of mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Soul may remember the readineſs, the quickneſs, the activity of the Heart in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of obedience to the Lords bleſſed will. Now from hence the Soul may fetch a ſtrong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherewith to come before the Throne of Grace; O my God may the believing Soul ſay, <hi>When thy bleſſed Spirit of light had the pretious ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration upon my Heart, what a bleſſed concurrence was there in this my crooked oppoſite will, to this thy holy will; O what an union of love was there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this thy Majeſty and my oppoſite Heart, how impatient then was my Soul, of any diſagreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my will and thy will, how readily was my heart diſpoſed for any thing thy bleſſed Majeſty command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? But now alas Lord, now the workings of the Spirit of light are ſuſpended, what a diſagreement is there between thy Majeſties will and my will; how ſtrait and narrow, and weak and feeble, are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of my Heart now to obedience to thy bleſſed will?</hi> Lord may the Soul ſay; <hi>Have reſpect to thine own honour, ſend down the Spirit of light into this dark Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Soul may remember how highly the bleſſed Name of God was exalted and magnified in his Heart, when that bleſſed Spirit of light continued its bleſſed operation to evidence actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally its union with the Lord Jeſus. Now from thence, the Soul from whom the luſtre and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of theſe his former evidences of union with
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:48673:250"/>
Chriſt is now Ecclipſed, may argue with the bleſſed Majeſty of Heaven to ſend down the ſame Spirit of light and manifeſtation again to his dark Soul.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Even when the orient brightneſs, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly luſtre of the Souls former evidences is Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed and darkned, yet then the Soul may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the capaciouſneſs, and enlarged open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Heart towards communion with God, while the orient luſtre of the evidences of his union with Chriſt did actually remain. Now from hence the Soul may gather ſtrength of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to appear before the Lord, to Petition the return of the bleſſed Spirit of light and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation again to his Soul: The Soul may plead that the ſuitableneſs, and right diſpoſition of the Heart for Communion with the Lord, depends upon the enjoyment of the Spirit of light and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Even when the orient brightneſs of the Souls former evidences are ecclipſed and obſcured, yet then the Soul may remember how gloriouſly the lovely beauty, and Soul enamouring brightneſs of the way of holineſs was tranſparent through him, when the Heavenly luſtre of his former evidences did actually remain in the Soul. Now from hence the Soul may gather a pretious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, whereby he may lay an engagement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Majeſty of Heaven, to ſend down the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of light again: Thence the Soul may plead, that the luſtre and Heavenly beauty of the ways of holineſs to be manifeſted through him, depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his enjoyment of the Spirit of light and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="486" facs="tcp:48673:251"/>6. When the cammanding power of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a Souls union with Chriſt is ceaſed for the preſent, to evidence to the Soul its union, yet then the Soul may remember that the tender compaſſionate bowels of God have moved within him, and yearned toward his Soul formerly. Now from thence the feeble, almoſt fainting drooping Soul, may ſtill gather more ſtrength, and lift up its Head again, to claim the Spirit of light and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation, to be ſent from Heaven into his dark Soul.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When the ſplendor, and beauty, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying power of the evidences that the Soul have received of his union with Jeſus Chriſt be decayed, yet then the Soul may remember, that all his abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable wickedneſs, and moſt curſed vileneſs, did not formerly prevent ſome movings of the Bowels of the Lords mercy towards him. Now hence may the Soul gather ſtrength to plead for the returns of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> bleſſed Spirit of light into his dark Soul. Hence the Soul may plead, that there is the ſame reaſon, the ſame motive to incline the Lords bleſſed will, to ſend now the Spirit of light and manifeſtation to it, that ever there was to incline his Majeſty to the leaſt thought of kindneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Soul from whoſe Eyes ſome dark Clouds hath obſcured the former luſtre of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, yet may remember that ſome ſpark of holy confidence in the Lords bleſſed will, to admit the Soul into union with Jeſus Chriſt, was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infuſed into his unbelieving Heart. Now from thence the Soul may again gather ſome ſtrength, whereby to lay hold upon the Lord, and to engage
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:48673:251"/>
him, to give as it were a new Commiſſion to the Spirit of light to come down to his dark Soul: Thence the Soul may plead the Lords engagement, never to recall the gift once paſt, out of the hand of his pretious love, he having declared his Gifts are without Repentance; and thence the Soul may plead, that the Lord ſtands engaged to nouriſh up that confidence, ſo begotten in the Heart by his bleſſed Spirit.</p>
               <p n="9">9. When the irreſiſtible commanding power of the evidence that any Soul hath received of his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt be weak, yet then the Soul may remember the uſeleſneſs, the inefficatiouſneſs of all terrors and diſtractions upon his Spirit, and the moſt bleſſed efficacy that the leaſt glimpſe of light, diſcovering to the Soul, the Lords will to admit it into union, had upon his Heart. Now from hence the Soul may cry to the Lord, and complain in the bitterneſs of his Soul, <hi>that he underſtands not what his bleſſed will concerning him is, in terrifying and affrighting, ſuffring his Spirit even to be diſtracted with terror.</hi> Lord may the Soul ſay, <hi>Hath thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty its honour from me this way? Is thy Name exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my Heart in this manner? Will my Heart ever bow in obedience to thy bleſſed Will, through the power of thoſe terrors and diſtractions that are upon me?</hi> This holy arguing and expoſtulating with the bleſſed Majeſty of Heaven, and engaging him by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, collected from what the Soul remembers, in his former evidences of his union with Chriſt, is the laſt holy uſe that the Soul may make of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer evidences of his union, when their Heavenly luſtre, and commanding power and beauty ceaſe. And I would perſwade every obſcure Soul, from
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:48673:252" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whoſe Eyes thoſe ſweet Heavenly beams of light are now hidden (with which his Eyes were once bleſſed) above all the other uſes, to have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reſpect to this laſt uſe, thus to gain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, to inſinuate its ſelf into the love and favour of the Lord again, to engage the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Heaven by this kind of pleading with him, to ſend down the Spirit of light and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation afreſh. This indeed is the very principal uſe of the former evidence, wherefor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> preſent darkneſs overſpread it, and that in theſe Two re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In regard in this kind of pleading, the poor decaying ſparks of the Souls confidence, is kept in ſome degree alive. Now the ſtronger the Souls confidence is, the more ſuitable is the Soul to make a righteous examination, or juſt and impartial tryal, of thoſe former evidences of his union with the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In thoſe pleadings, the Spirit of light may be again expected to return. The bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and all the actings of it, are reſerved in the Golden Cloſet of the Promiſes, wherein the Lord hath engaged himſelf to Communicate whatever mercy and love ſhall be ſuitable to the poor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Soul; and theſe holy pleadings are the Key to the Door of the Golden Cloſet; I mean, the Key of the Promiſe, to open the Door for the Spirit of lighr to have its free acceſs. Queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by ſuch a holy improvement of former evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences as this, believing Souls might be much furthered towards the obtaining of the renewed operations of the ſpirit of light, and manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of renewed diſcoveries from the ſame Spirit
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:48673:252"/>
unto the Souls faith, of the Lords will to receive him into union with the Lord Jeſus. Thus now you have the Queſtion alſo caſt in upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion opened: It is apparent there is a pretious holy uſe that Souls may make of all former evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences when their orient brightneſs is ecclipſed, and their commanding power is weakned, though the Soul cannot then take an impartial exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of thoſe his evidences or put them upon ſuch a righteous Trial whether they be really from God or no.</p>
               <p>One conſideration alſo I muſt add concerning knowledge, whether evidences of union recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved be really from God, or whether they be Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical inſpirations.. The Soul muſt underſtand that this knowledge is a collection, or gathering of this concluſion, that his evidences received are really from God, from a certain, neceſſary, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible reaſon. The difference between know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the evidence to be really from God, and Opinion, and Faith, muſt always be kept clear in the Souls underſtanding, who ſhall be able to receive a right anſwer to that grand Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion propounded. To believe the Souls eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that he hath received of his union with Jeſus Chriſt; to be really from God, is an act of the Soul that hath its foundation only upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of him that relates, or diſcovers it to the Soul. There are two things whereupon faith is founded.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the thing believed is ſpoken or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="490" facs="tcp:48673:253"/>Secondly, That the Speaker or Declarer is true and faithful. Now to have an Opinion that the evidences of the Souls union with Chriſt received, are really from God, is to collect or gather the concluſion of it from ſome proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaſon, as from the adjunct, or the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that follow in his Soul upon his recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the evidences of his union with Chriſt: But the knowledge that the evidences of a Souls union with Chriſt received, is really from God, is the collection of this concluſion to the Soul, from a certain, neceſſary, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible reaſon. Therefore your Philoſophers in diſtinguiſhing between knowledge and opinion, define knowledge to be a certain true habit of the mind: And they define Opinion to be an uncertain habit in the mind. So that he that propounds the Queſtion; How a Soul that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth he hath received ſufficient and ſatisfying evidence of his union with the Lord Jeſus, may know certainly and infallibly, that the evidence of his union received is really from God, he muſt underſtand that he asks, How a Soul may demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to himſelf from certain neceſſary reaſons, that the evidences of his union with Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived are really from God.

               <p>Queſt. <hi>How ſhall any Soul that conceiveth he hath received, and doth actually enjoy, certain and ſufficient evidences of his union with the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, demonſtrate from certain neceſſary and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent reaſons, that thoſe his evidences are really from God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For Anſwer then directly to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. There are but two kind of Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereby a Soul can demonſtrate to its ſelf the reality of his evidence received proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God.</p>
               <p>You muſt underſtand we are now ſpeaking of knowledge; and what was ſpoken before of faith, muſt not come into our remembrance in this thing: For you muſt remember we gave you a diſtinction between knowledge, faith, and opinion, we look not for opinion now; That is, ſome probable ground of our union with Jeſus Chriſt: nor we do not look to faith which is the declaration of Gods will to admit it into union with Jeſus Chriſt: But we look to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and there are but Two Demonſtrations, a Demonſtration <hi>Priori,</hi> and a Demonſtration <hi>à Poſteriori;</hi> A Demonſtration taken from the Cauſes, and a Demonſtration taken from the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="492" facs="tcp:48673:254"/>The firſt and moſt certain ground, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soul may prove its union from God, is taken from the cauſes; now the Cauſes are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: But the Two Principal Reaſons muſt be taken from the Two Principal Cauſes. Now there are but Two Principal Cauſes of the Souls union with the Lord Jeſus, both which concur together, and are never ſeparated one from another. The Two efficient Cauſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental, is the Lords bleſſed written Word, and that pretious Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt. The written Word is the more remote cauſe, and the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus is the more immediate efficient cauſe.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe the reaſon whereby we may draw any concluſion is moſt ſtrong, that it is taken from the moſt immediate cauſe of any thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And in reſpect that the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt is the moſt immediate efficient cauſe (though but ſtill inſtrumental) becauſe the Spirit doth more immediately ſend down thoſe beams of light, that do moſt clearly reveal to faith the Lords will, to take the Soul into union with Chriſt, and alſo thoſe beams of light that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to the Soul the integrity of his Heart in believing; Thence we ſhall firſt ſpeak of that reaſon which is taken from the bleſſed Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt; and ſo I anſwer thus, That the firſt primary and principal reaſon from whence a Soul may conclude, that the evidences of his union received are really from God is, that thoſe evidencing beams of light doth proceed from the bleſſed Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt. And it
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:48673:254"/>
is the knowledge of this, that they are thoſe beams of light proceeding from the Spirit of Chriſt, by which a Soul attains the moſt certain and infallible knowledge, that his evidences were from God; by this he attains that which is moſt properly called knowledge; according as the Philoſophers ſay, to know a thing, is to diſcern the nature or being of it by its moſt proper immediate cauſe. But now leaſt the Soul ſhould ſay, you here anſwer one doubt by another, which is as great a doubt, and leads the Soul but on into further darkneſs; the Soul is as doubtful of this you will ſay, whether thoſe beams of light proceed from the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, as it is whether they were from God? Therefore for your ſatisfaction here muſt be Two things opened.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the light that doth proceed from the bleſſed Spirit of Chriſt, to evidence unto any Soul its union with Jeſus Chriſt, doth evidence, that it doth proceed from the bleſſed Spirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It muſt be opened, that the light that ſo proceeds from the Spirit to evidence to the Soul its union with Chriſt, is the moſt potent, and powerful demonſtration, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets the moſt certain knowledge of the Souls union with Chriſt, even the moſt proper and higheſt kind of knowledge.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It muſt be manifeſted that the light that proceeds from the Spirit, to evidence to any Soul its union with Chriſt, doth evidence it ſelf to proceed from the Spirit. There are ſuch ſparklings of Divinity in thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:48673:255"/>
Beams of Light, that the ſpirit ſends down into any Believing ſoul to diſcover its union, that the eye that beholds thoſe Beams of Light, ſee the very Divinity of them, he ſeeth that they come out from God: There is ſuch Coruſcations; or Bright ſhinings of Heavenly Glory upon thoſe Beams of Divine Light, as gives a ſatisfying diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery that they are from the Spirit of God; Thoſe beams of light they bear the Image of God upon them, they have in a manner the name of the bleſſed ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt Ingraven upon them, that the ſoul that beholds them even reads the name of the bleſſed ſpirit Ingraven there: So that thoſe Beams of light (by an inſeparable property that the Lord hath annexed to them) do ſo diſcover their Original to be from the ſpirit of God, as they do ſatisfy every ſoul to whom they are ſent down, and make it unqueſtionable that they are from the Spirit of God: Yea the name of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is ſo palinly Ingraven upon thoſe beams of Light, that the ſoul ſo eaſily diſcerns it, that all Fears, Doubts, and Suſpitions, all workings of Jealouſie, that thoſe evidencing beams of light are not from the ſpirit, are Baniſhed by their Mighty Power: I mean, the ſoul injoying thoſe, at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant while their luſtre, their Hevenly bright ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Coruſcations and Glory continue, the ſoul fears not that they are Deluſions, he doth not ſo much as queſtion that they are Deluſions: According to that in 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.27. <hi>But the Anointing which ye have Received of him abideth in you:</hi> That is, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Jeſus Chriſt Communicated to you abides in you, which is here called the Anointing, becauſe according to that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1, 2. The pouring out
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:48673:255"/>
of the ſpirit of Grace and Holineſs upon Chriſt as Mediatour, is called the Anointing of Chriſt for his Mediatorial Office, and ſo the participating of the ſpirit by Believers, is called the Anointing of Believers to partake of their head: Now ſaith he, the Anointing abides in you, that is, the ſpirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides in you, and ye need not that any man teach you, but as the ſame anointing teaches you all things, and is truth and is no lye: The ſpirit teaches you all things; He doth not mean of all truth, and the whole Counſel of God, for that no believing ſoul yet underſtood while he dwelt in Houſes of Clay, (<hi>Paul</hi> himſelf underſtanding but in part) but he ſpeaks of the truths forenamed, the grand Goſpel Truths, the ſpirit it ſelf teaches you all things, that is, of theſe things mentioned; Teach ye that you ſhall have eternal Life in Jeſus Chriſt: And mark, and is truth and is no lye; That is to ſay, it teaches you ſo that you know it is truth, and you know ye are not deceived while that ſo teaches, or in its teaching: And therefore he ſaith in the former words, that they need not that any man ſhould teach them; Not that there is no neceſſity of the Pretious Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Jeſus Chriſt ſtill for their ſouls, whereby the truth of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be brought to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and the Pretious Actings of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Diſpoſition in all theſe drawn forth, for that's neceſſary for every believing ſoul; But thus, you need not that any man teach you, that is, you need no other Confirmation of the truth of theſe things, then what the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt gave you; you need not that any man ſhould come to give a clearer diſcovery of the certainty and truth of thoſe. And thence alſo in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. The
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:48673:256"/>
Apoſtle affirms, <hi>that they had received the Spirit of God, that did teach them to know the things given to them of God, v.</hi> 10. That <hi>God had revealed his truth to them by the Spirit.</hi> Now this muſt be further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by divers reaſons, that the light that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Spirit of Chriſt, revealing to the Soul its union with Chriſt, doth evidence to the Soul that it doth proceed from Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard it is the teſtimony of God unto the Soul concerning its union. Now that witneſs or teſtimony of God to the ſoul concerning its union, if it did not evidence even by its own light, that it did proceed from the Spirit of God, it were no witneſs of God at all unto the Soul concerning its union. It is of greater concernment to the Soul in this caſe, to underſtand who it is that ſpeaks, than to underſtand what it is that is ſpoken; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Soul underſtands clearly, that the light that now came into his Soul doth proceed from the Spirit of God, he underſtands not that it is Gods witneſs: It is not ſo much the thing that is teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as the conſideration of him who it is that teſtifies, that ſatisfies the ſoul, or makes it to be the Witneſs of God to the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard the evidence is the teſtimony from God, on purpoſe to give the ſoul ſatisfaction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his union, to revive, refreſh, and comfort the ſoul, by the diſcovery of his union with Chriſt. Thence it is, that Chriſt in his promiſing to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to <hi>ſend his bleſſed ſpirit to dwell in their hearts, while he was abſent from them, John</hi> 14.16. He names the ſpirit <hi>the Comforter,</hi> revealing what the Office of the ſpirit is by his Name. Now ſhould not the light from the ſpirit, that doth
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:48673:256"/>
evidence to the ſoul his union with Chriſt, evidence it ſelf alſo to be from the ſpirit of Chriſt, that teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God that is from that light to the ſoul, could give no ſatisfaction to the doubtful ſcrupulous ſoul: Therefore doubtleſs the light from the ſpirit doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways carry ſufficient evidence for it ſelf, to evidence from it ſelf whence it is; ſeeing God intends thoſe beams of light to give ſatisfaction to the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard that light from the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt is the higheſt witneſs, or teſtimony unto a ſoul concerning his union. Now ſeeing that thoſe beams of light are the higheſt witneſs, there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſicity that thoſe beams of light ſhould evidence themſelves what they are, by an inſeparable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of their own, otherwiſe their witneſs muſt be ſubject to be tried by the teſtimony of ſomething elſe; ſo that the higheſt witneſs of the ſpirit muſt come to be ſubject to this holy quality and that precious diſpoſition.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Should not the light that proceeds from the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to diſcover to a ſouls faith and ſenſe his union with Chriſt, evidence it ſelf to be from the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, then the bleſſed teſtimony of the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be altogether vain and uſeleſs. Thoſe ſweeteſt beams of heavenly light are the ſpirits voice; and ſhould it ſpeak in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue, that is, ſhould not its voice be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from all other voices, the ſpirit ſhould but beat the air, that is, all the light that it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers to the ſoul of its union with Chriſt ſhould be fruſtrated, void and of none effect.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In regard the ſpirit of Chriſt necſſarily ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fills the office to which Jeſus Chriſt hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="498" facs="tcp:48673:257"/>The Lord hath deſtinated that Spirit of his to Seal up Believers, to Seal up their Inheritance, <hi>Eph.</hi> 13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.30: Now a Seal is deſtinated on purpoſe to give a peculiar Confirmation of the thing Sealed. Yea likewiſe the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt is deſtinated to be the Earneſt in the Believers ſoul whom it is ſent to Seal, to be the Earneſt of his Inheritance, according to that in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13.</p>
               <p>Saith the Original, it is Tranſlated [which,] but it is rather [who] is the earneſt of our Inheritance, or who is the Pledge: The word ſignifies ſome part of a price paid beforehand, to aſſure the Payment of a full Price, for ſome Commodity bought: So that the meaning is, who is given you as a part before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, of that full Inheritance that you may expect, and may be the better aſſured that you ſhall injoy the full Inheritance. Now did not the ſpirit of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt make thoſe Beams of Light (ſent down into any ſoul to diſcover to them their union with Chriſt) to diſcover themſelves to be from the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the ſoul ſhould remain dubious after the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Teſtimony of the ſpirit, whether he had received the ſpirit of Chriſt or no, and ſo the ſpirit of Chriſt in his Sealing Office ſhould be no earneſt, ſeeing the ſpirit muſt be an earneſt as it diſcovers it ſelf to be in the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In regard it is the Light of the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt, that is the only Diſcoverer of all Divine things, that makes all things manifeſt. It is light that makes all things manifeſt; Now the Spirit of Chriſt is the only ſpirit of Light and Wiſdom, and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: So that there can nothing be made manifeſt to the ſoul, but what ſome Beam of Light from the
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:48673:257"/>
ſpirit of Light muſt manifeſt: And then obſerve it, whatever reaſon any ſoul ſhould ſtudy to prove the Beams of Light, that were ſent down into his ſoul (to diſcover to him his union with Chriſt) were from the ſpirit, even that reaſon muſt be diſcovered in the Truth and Reality of it, by ſome Beam of Light from the ſpirit, and then unleſs the Beam of Light from the ſpirit doth carry ſufficient Evidence in it, to diſcover it ſelf to be from the ſpirit, the ſoul ſhould be deceived in the reality of that very reaſon, that he ſtudied up to prove, that the former Beams of Light that were ſent down into his ſoul came down from the ſpirit. To ſpeak more plainly thus, ſeeing the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt is only the ſpirit of light, whatever Holy Diſpoſitions, whatever Preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Heavenly Quality any Believing ſoul ſhall diſcern in it ſelf, it muſt be diſcerned by a Beam of light from the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſecond thing to be opened is, That the light that proceeds from the ſpirit to diſcover to the ſoul its union with Chriſt, is the moſt Potent, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Demonſtration of its own proceeding from God, which begets the moſt Certain and Infallible knowledge in the ſoul of his union with Chriſt. That pretious light of the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt, doth ſo clearly diſcover it ſelf to be from the ſpirit of Chriſt, that there can be no reaſon that can make any Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Increaſe of that pretious clearneſs: It ſhines ſo brightly with the very Image of the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt upon it, as nothing can make it more manifeſt to be from the ſpirit than its own light. This will appear in divers particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="500" facs="tcp:48673:258"/>I. In regard that Beam of light that proceeds from the ſpirit, to diſcover to the ſoul its union with Chriſt, diſcovers nothing but what is infallibly true. Not only what is infallibly true in it ſelf, but it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers nothing but what is infallibly true to the ſouls Apprehenſion to whom it doth diſcover it. Now when the Principles of a Demonſtration are infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly true, then hath it the firſt property of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt Potent Demonſtration.</p>
               <p n="2">II. In regard that light which diſcovers the firſt light of the ſpirit, to be the light of the ſpirit, doth alſo again Evidence it ſelf to be the light of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit alſo. Now that's the higheſt demonſtrative Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to prove that any thing proceeds from God, that is to ſay, that it is diſcovered by the ſpirit of God: Now that light of the ſpirits firſt light, doth plainly demonſtrate that to the ſoul that it comes from the ſpirit of God: So that there is no other Medium, no other reaſon that can be imagined higher, to prove that the firſt light from the ſpirit, that diſcovers to the ſoul its union with Chriſt was from God.</p>
               <p n="3">III. In regard it is the moſt evident perſpicuous diſcovery of thoſe beams of light to be from God, that can poſſibly be given. Every reaſon from whence any Concluſion is Collected, muſt be clearer and more evident than the Concluſion it ſelf. Now it is only the light of the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt, which is more evident and clear than the Concluſion it ſelf drawn that the Evidences are really from God: So that if it were poſſible for a higher proof to be made, of the certainty of the beams of light, that diſcovers to a ſoul its union with Chriſt, of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:48673:258"/>
of their being from God, then this very light that theſe Beams of light contain in themſelves, then there muſt be ſome light clearer than the very firſt light, that proceeds from the ſpirit of light and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation, whoſe office it is to diſcover all things to the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. In regard it is that light only that can truly inforce, or cauſe the Concluſion to be drawn, that the Beams of light that did diſcover to the ſoul its union with Chriſt were from God. Now that's the higheſt kind of demonſtrative Reaſon, to ſhew the truth or reality of any thing, when the principles, (that is the reaſons from whence the Concluſion is Collected) are the cauſe of the Concluſion: Now thus the light of the ſpirit was thoſe Beams of light, that diſcovered to my ſoul, its union with the Lord Jeſus was really from God: why? becauſe they came from the ſpirit of God. Such Premiſes as theſe, to ſay what the ſpirit of God reveals and diſcovers, that muſt of neceſſity proceed from God, doth even force the Concluſion to be drawn: Whereas nothing elſe hath ſo much power in it to cauſe the Concluſion to be drawn, as that light that proceeds from the ſpirit. Now from theſe things opened, you may hence take notice, that every ſoul to whole Faith and Sence, the ſpirit of Chriſt hath truly Revealed their union with Chriſt, have full ſatisfaction, clear undoubted ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, concerning his union with the Lord Jeſus, in all its moſt Serious, Deliberate Meditations and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations: So that ſo long as thoſe Pretious Beams of light from the ſpirit, do remain actually ſhining into the ſoul, there is no kind of Doubt, Scruple, or Darkneſs in the ſoul about its union with the Lord
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:48673:259"/>
Jeſus; So that any ſoul that hath received this tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> diſcovery from the ſpirit of light, both unto Faith and Senſe, of his union with the Lord Jeſus, need not inquire for any more proofs, than his own ſoul poſſeſſeth at that inſtant, that God and his ſoul are one through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>§. Secondly, The ſecond Inſtrumental cauſe, that ſhines into any heart really from God, to diſcover to that heart his union with Jeſus Chriſt, is the Lords Pretious Word. That Heavenly light that ſhines into any dark and doubtful heart, to reveal its union with the Lord Jeſus to it clearly, is only a pretious ſpark that ſparkles forth from the Pretious Burning Lamp of the Lords Written Word; And it is the Bleſſed Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt that doth as it were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe and Inflame that burning lamp of the Lords Bleſſed Word, and cauſe it to ſend forth thoſe Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſparks into dark hearts; And it is that ſame Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſpirit alſo that enlightens thoſe dark hearts, to ſee, diſcern, and behold thoſe ſparks, that that burning lamp of the Lords Word ſend forth: So that the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt and the Written Word, are but Concauſes that joyntly and ſweetly joyn together, to enlighten the Doubtful ſoul, and clearly reveal its union with the Lord Jeſus. So that the ſoul hath for his aſſurance, the hand of the ever Bleſſed God, and the Teſtimony of God that it is his own hand: He hath that ſecret light that diſcovers it ſelf to be of God, which diſcovers to the ſouls faith his union with Chriſt, and to his ſenſe the truth of his own believing act; And hath the Written Word, which is a Letter Written from the Almighty to loveleſs ſouls, that bears Witneſs alſo to the ſame thing. So
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:48673:259"/>
that then the ſecond reaſon, next to the prime rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon (that the light that the ſoul receiveth proceeds from the ſpirit of God) is this, that the ſoul beholds it clearly ſhine forth from the Lords Written Word. But to clear this there muſt be two things opened.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That a believing ſoul ought to receive the light that diſcovers to him his union with the Lord Jeſus, from the Written Word of God, and ought to receive that light as certain and infallible, becauſe it ſhines from the Written Word.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the Lords Pretious Written Word, doth diſcover to particular believing ſouls, their particular union with the Lord Jeſus, both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Faith, and unto their Sence.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It muſt be cleared, That a believing ſoul ought to receive the light, that diſcovers to his ſoul his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Lord Jeſus, from the written Word; and ought to receive it as certain and infallible, becauſe it proceeds from the Written Word. This appears.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In regard it is the direct Command of Heaven, that believing ſouls ſhould ſtick and cleave only, to that truth that is diſcovered in the Lords Written Word; And that believing ſouls ſhould be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the truth of that Pretious Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe it is contained in the Lords Written Word, in the book of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> This you ſhall find in that 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14, 15, 16. <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue thou in the things which thou haſt learned, and haſt been aſſured of, knowing of whom thou haſt learned them; And that from a Child thou haſt known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee Wiſe unto Salvation, through Faith which is in</hi> Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:48673:260"/>
Correction, for Instruction in Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt it is neceſſary here to obſerve the occaſion: you ſhall find in the beginning of the Chapter, the Apoſtle had fore-told of perilous times approaching, wherein there ſhould be many falſe Doctors in the World, in whoſe Snares many ſouls ſhould be taken Captives; Therefore leaſt <hi>Timothy</hi> alſo ſhould be Inſnared, the Apoſtle Writes theſe Verſes on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to endeavour to Eſtabliſh <hi>Tymothy</hi>'s ſoul in the truth; Saith he, <hi>Continue thou in the things which thou haſt Learned, knowing of whom thou haſt Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them:</hi> Now the Arguments he uſeth to ſettle <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> in the truth are two;</p>
               <p>Firſt from his <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Call; knowing from whom thou haſt learned them; From an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt that had received it from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Argument is in thoſe next Verſes, <hi>That from a Child thou haſt known the Holy Scriptures; The Writings of the Prophets, and thoſe Holy Men of God, that ſpake as they were moved by the Spirit of God, that the Lord cauſed to be Written as a Rule:</hi> Now this being his Argument, <hi>to continue in the truth of the Goſpel Received,</hi> the Apoſtle doth illuſtrate it by three or four things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He diſcovers to him that thoſe Writings of the Holy Men of God that he had been acquainted with; were able to make him Wiſe unto Salvation, through Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, that is, if his ſoul did receive thoſe diſcoveries in thoſe Scriptures by Faith; So that the Apoſtle intimates thus much; That it were infinite Folly in <hi>Timothy</hi> to receive any other Doctrine, than what he had taught, and what he had learned to be written in the holy Scriptures, ſeeing the Wiſdom of God to Salvation was contained in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="505" facs="tcp:48673:260"/>Secondly, He illuſtrates this Argument by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reaſon, and that's taken from the Authority of thoſe Holy Scriptures. The matter contained in them, ſaith the Apoſtle is ſuch, as was given by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of God: The matter contained in them was but the Breathing of God, into the ſouls of thoſe men that Wrote it, It is Gods Voice to thy ſoul, ſaith he, therefore take heed thou continue in the Doctrine there diſcovered.</p>
               <p>Thirdly he illuſtrates this Argument by a reaſon taken from the uſe of thoſe Holy Scriptures, and that is in theſe Words; <hi>It is Profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> It is <hi>Profitable for Doctrine,</hi> that is, for all matters of Faith; It will inſtruct thee, ſaith he, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that the Lord commands thy ſoul to believe. Yea it is profitable for reproof alſo, for overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all falſe Opinions, that are contrary to the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt. Yea for Correction, that is, for the Reproving all Evil Manners whatever, for Correcting all Vitious ways whatever they are.

Yea the Apoſtle ſeems to add a fourth reaſon to illuſtrate this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that is in thoſe next Words, which he takes for the end of Writing theſe Holy Scriptures, and that is the Perfecting the Man of God; <hi>That the Man of God might be Perfect, throughly Furniſhed,</hi> Furniſhed unto all Perfection.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It appears that the ſoul ought to receive the light that ſhines from the written word, in regard the written word of the Lord is given by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as an everlaſting, unchangeable rule for the
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:48673:261" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tryal of truth and falſehood. Hence it is that Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, when he was to make it manifeſt to the unbelieving Jews, that he himſelf was the Son of God, he fetcheth his higheſt teſtimony from the written word, as you may obſerve, <hi>John</hi> 5. in comparing <hi>ver.</hi> 31 and ſo on, and <hi>ver.</hi> 39 toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: He tells them he would not bear witneſs of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, leaſt his witneſs ſhould not have evidenced de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration enough to bear witneſs to him, becauſe it is from himſelf; but he tells them <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt bears witneſs to him, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. He gives them a ſecond argument from his work, <hi>ver.</hi> 36. and <hi>ver,</hi> 37. <hi>The Father that ſent him bare witneſs of him:</hi> but <hi>ver.</hi> 39. to give that that ſhould be an undeniable teſtimony, even unto the apprehenſions of the Jews themſelves, he tells them that the Scriptures, (the holy writings of thoſe holy men of God) they te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify of him, ſaith he, <hi>ſearch the Scriptures for in them ye think ye have eternal Life, and they are they which teſtifie of me.</hi> Hence when <hi>Paul</hi> began to preach Jeſus Chriſt, and to prove that Jeſus of <hi>Nazereth</hi> whom he preached, was the Mediator between God and man, he perſwaded them concerning Jeſus, both out of the Law of Moſes and out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>Acts.</hi> 28.23. and thence it is that in <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. That thoſe Men of <hi>Berea</hi> preached, <hi>by ſearching the Scriptures daily whether thoſe things were ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly it muſt be cleared, that the written word of God doth particularly reveal unto belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſouls their union with Chriſt, both unto their faith and unto their ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It doth reveal particularly unto their faith, their infallible admiſſion into union with the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. This appears in regard the Lords teſtimony
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:48673:261" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that he will admit every ſoul that will, into union with Jeſus Chriſt, is abſolutely univerſal, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt acceptation or limitation; ſo that it comprehends every particular ſoul whatever to whom the Goſpel is preached; according to that in <hi>John</hi> 3.15. <hi>That whoſoever believed on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life.</hi> So in <hi>John</hi> 6.37, <hi>He that cometh to Jeſus Chriſt he will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> And in <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. <hi>That whoſover be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him ſhould have Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> and that known place <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Whoever will, let him take the water of Life freely,</hi> wherein it is apparent that every particular ſoul is included, that the Lords teſtimony to every particular ſoul is as certain as if the particular ſoul were named, that the ſoul ſhall be admitted into union with the Lord Jeſus: if the ſoul will accept it, if the ſoul will conſent to his truth, and truſt to his truth and faithfulneſs for the fulfilling that his word. Now whereas it is obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that no particular word ſpeaks to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſoul; and ſays thou <hi>Thomas,</hi> and thou <hi>John,</hi> or thou <hi>Eliſabeth,</hi> or thou <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhalt be accepted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to union with the Lord Jeſus, if thou wilt accept him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I anſwer that either every particular is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly comprehended in the univerſal offer, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal command of believing, as if the Lord ſhould name every perſon to whom he ſpeaks; or elſe there can be no faith of aſſurance concerning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Goſpel-truth whatever. Elſe there can be no aſſurance that our Bodies ſhall riſe again from the duſt, and appear before the judgement-ſeat of Chriſt. It is no where ſaid, thou <hi>Thomas,</hi> or thou <hi>John,</hi> or thou <hi>Mary</hi> ſhalt ariſe out of the duſt again and come
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:48673:262" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to judgement; yet I ſuppoſe every one that hath the leaſt beam of ſpiritual light ſhining down into his ſoul will acknwledge that the written word of God doth reveal particularly, that this ſoul and that ſoul, even his own ſoul ſhall ariſe from the duſt and come to judgemen. Now it is apparent, that there is as clear a diſcovery in the written word to any particular ſouls faith of his certain reſurrection from the dead and coming to judgement.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Either all thoſe particulars are to be fully comprehended in that univerſal offer, and univerſal unlimited command of believing, or elſe there were no obedience to the will of God commanded to any particular ſoul whatever, nor no diſobedience to the will of God reproved. It is no where ſaid, thou <hi>Thomas,</hi> or thou <hi>John</hi> ſhalt worſhip the Lord in Prayer; It is no where ſaid, thou <hi>Thomas,</hi> or thou <hi>Mary</hi> ſhalt receive me as thy only God, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip me only. Likewiſe no diſobedience to the will of God were reproved: It is no where ſaid, thou <hi>Thomas</hi> ſhalt not ſteal, thou <hi>John</hi> ſhalt not lye, thou <hi>Mary</hi> ſhalt not commit adultery: yet I conceive, thou whoſe believing diſpoſition is moſt out of exerciſe at preſent, dareſt not ſay, God hath not ſaid to thy ſoul do not ſteal, do not lye, that God hath not commanded thee to worſhip him in his ordinances appointed. So that it is clear the word of God doth reveal to particular ſouls undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, their certain admiſſion into union with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in caſe they accept him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The precious written word of God, reveals unto particular ſouls ſenſe, their particular union with the Lord Jeſus. That is to ſay, whenever the ſpirit of light and manifeſtation ſent from the
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:48673:262"/>
Lord Jeſus ſhall irradiate the precious written word of God, ſo as to make its own heavenly light ſhine into a dark heart, and alſo irradiate at the ſame time or caſt beams of light upon the precious believing act, that the ſame ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt hath begotten in that ſoul, then that light that the written word of God holds forth particularly, declares to ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſoul its certain actual union with the Lord Jeſus. Now the written word of God ſpeaks to the ſenſe of a believing ſoul, his union with the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in theſe two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In its general deſcription of the nature of that believing act that the Lord requires from the ſoul. Now the written word deſcribing the nature of that believing act that the Lord requires in general, and declaring that believing act to be required in the ſame manner from every ſoul; that written word of God doth particularly reveal unto ſuch a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſouls ſenſe, his actual union with the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: as thus, the written word of the Lord deſcribes the nature of the believing act to be a coming to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. to be receiving the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God that he gave concerning his Son, ſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its ſeal that God is true <hi>John.</hi> 3.33. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Record that God hath given of his Son, 1, <hi>John.</hi> 5.7, 8, 9. To be a receiving of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>John</hi> 1.12 To be a will in the ſoul concurring with what the Lord tenders, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. Now I ſay in the ſpirits deſcribing the general nature of that believing act the Lord requires, it doth ſpeak particularly to the believing ſoul, when the ſpirit is ſo evidencing to him his union with the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and declares the ſouls certain and infallible uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Jeſus Chriſt. As thus, the ſpirit having
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:48673:263" rendition="simple:additions"/>
firſt revealed to the ſouls faith, the Lords will to admit having ſweetly encouraged the ſoul, yea powerfully, irreſiſtibly, effectually commanded the ſoul, to ſet to his ſeal that the Lord is true; and to ſay <hi>Lord be it unto thy Servant as thou haſt ſpoken;</hi> then the ſame ſpirit irradiates that written word that deſcribes the general nature of the believing act, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſoul diſcern, that the believing act is a ſweet conſent of the mind and heart to the truths of the Lord in the tender of the Lord Jeſus to him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the Father and him; and then the ſpirit irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diates alſo the precious conſent of the mind and heart, that holy truſt and confidence that is then in the ſoul, and then the written word ſaith particularly, that thou doſt conſent, to accept of what the Lord thus tenders in Chriſt to thee, thou art certainly and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſtingly united to the Lord Jeſus; thou art he who doſt receive what the Lord hath propounded in Chriſt ſo thee, and therefore thou art certainly lodged in the everlaſting arms of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond way that the written word dclares unto the particular ſouls ſenſe, his particular union with the Lord Jeſus is by its deſcription of the conſtant certain and inſeparable operation of the believing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, deſcribing the manner of the working of the believing diſpoſition, or deſcribing the various effects of faith.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the written word declaring that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per operation of faith, is by love to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By declaring that the proper operation of faith is to abaſe the ſoul in it ſelf, and make it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether nothing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Scripture doth declare that the proper
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:48673:263"/>
operation of faith is by purifying the heart, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it from all unholy diſpoſitions, <hi>Acts.</hi> 15 9.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In declaring that the proper operation of faith is an high and unſpeakable eſtimation of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3., 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9. Now thus the written word, declaring the proper manner of the operation of faith, doth declare particularly unto any particular ſoul, his union with Jeſus Chriſt: and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame written word declares, that in whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heart the believing diſpoſition thus particularly works; there is that precious believing act the Lord requires, there is that precious faith unfeigned that Jeſus Chriſt commands in his precious Goſpel; and ſo it ſpeaks particularly to a particular ſoul, thou doſt believe with that precious faith unfeigned that Jeſus Chriſt requires; and thus the ſpirit doth but make this written word of God ſpeak to the ſouls underſtanding, what it doth always ſpeak in it ſelf, which is, that that particular ſoul doth now believe according to the will of God: So that thence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the word of God doth ſpeak, and declare as particularly to a believing ſoul, his union with the Lord Jeſus as if it did ſpeak to any ſoul by name, for that light that diſcovers to the ſouls ſenſe and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or knowledge his union with Chriſt, is but the diſcovery of the truth of his own heart in believing the written worb ſpeaks as plainly to a particular ſouls ſenſe and Knowledge; his union with the Lord Jeſus, (that is, declares to him that he doth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly believe) as it doth declare to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar rebellious obſtinate ſinner that he particularly doth ſin; the word ſaith, whoſoever walks thus or thus tranſgreſſeth the will of God; now this ſpeaks to every particular ſoul ſo ſinning.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="512" facs="tcp:48673:264"/>Que. But the ſoul may ſay, how can a ſoul know that thoſe Books of the Old and New Teſtament are the Lords own word? May there not be ſome mixture of men?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">That the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are the writen word of God.</note>Anſw. For anſwer to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, firſt negatively, ſecondly affirmatively.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Negatively, I anſwer that the ſoul cannot be aſſured by all the powers and poſſibilities of men, no not by any created power, that the Books of the Old and New Teſtament are the written word of God. Though I deny not, that the teſtimony of men may give ſome kind of ground to the ſoul to believe it; and I fear the greateſt number among us have no other ground, yet no teſtimony of man can aſſure the ſoul ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that theſe are the Lords written word: the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contained in the written word of God is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpiritual, and therefore it muſt be a beam of ſpiritual light that muſt ſatisfyingly, and ſufficiently diſcover to a ſoul, that the ſpiritual matter is the truth of God, and did proceed from God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All the moſt exquiſite reaſoning, that the moſt elevated wits of man can extract, are not ſufficient to demonſtrate ſatisfyingly unto a ſoul, that the Books of the Old and New Teſtament are the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word of God himſelf indeed. If it were ſo, then the wiſeſt of men ſhould have been ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the word of God as the word of God; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Scripture teſtifies, the moſt wiſe have been moſt oppſite to receive it 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. Scribes and Phariſees, the wiſeſt of the People, were the greateſt oppoſers to our deareſt Redeemer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The written word of God barely and ſimply
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:48673:264"/>
taken, without the Mighty Power of the ſpirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurring with the Word, is not able to demonſtrate it ſelf to be the Word of God. Queſtionleſs if it were, then whoever had been partaker of the Written Word, or had heard the Word Preached that is Written, muſt in like manner have given credit to it; whereas the Scripture Teſtify, that when Jeſus Chriſt himſelf ſpake of thoſe things he had wrought, ſome Oppoſed and Blaſphemed.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="513-599" type="pages">
               <p>But then I anſwer affirmatively.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That the Bleſſed Spirit of God only, is able to demonſtrate Clearly, Evidently, Satisfyingly, and Infallibly unto a ſoul, that the Written Word of God is the Written Word of God. This the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle affirms directly 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9, to 12, that the ſpirit had Revealed thoſe things to them, which they by the Power of Reaſon could never comprehend; And that all the things given to them of God, are Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſpirit to be ſo given: And the Written Word of God is none of the ſmalleſt gifts of God to his people; Therefore conſequently it reveals that alſo to be given to them: So likewiſe he affirms, that it is the Spiritual Man that Judgeth all things (that is of truths) that is, it is only the Man Begotten by the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt unto God, and led by the light of that Bleſſed ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt, that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Judge of Truths, to Judge what Truths have their Original from God, and to Judge what have not their Original thence: It is the ſpirit alſo, ſaith he, that ſearches the deep things of God, that diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the very Myſtery of God to them, ſo as to make the Divinity ſhine forth in them: Whereas the moſt heightned reaſon, of the Accuteſt Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> can
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:48673:265"/>
diſcern nothing but Fooliſhneſs in the deep Myſteries of Godlineſs, <hi>v.</hi> 14. And indeed were it not the Teſtimony of that Bleſſed Spirit to a Believers Heart, that the Books of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament</hi> are the Lords <hi>Written Word,</hi> that they have their Original from the Lord himſelf, then the Foundation of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Faith were not a <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> neither could a Believer ſay, in believing any truth contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thoſe Books, that he knew whom he hath Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, with a Relation to God himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">II. When that ever Bleſſed Spirit doth reveal to any Believing ſoul, the <hi>Written Word</hi> to be the <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word</hi> of God, then the proper light of the <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word</hi> it ſelf, ſhines forth ſo gloriouſly; as it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it ſelf alſo to be the <hi>Lords Word.</hi> That is to ſay, the matter of the Lords <hi>Written Word,</hi> appears to be ſo Tranſcendent, ſo far ſurpaſſing the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of weak men; yea the quality of the <hi>Word</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be ſo Holy, ſo Pure and Undefiled, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>Powers</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and ſo contrary to the Tyranny and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that mans Corrupt Affections naturally deſire to bear over him; yea the quality of the <hi>Word</hi> appears to be ſo Unſpeakably, Unconceivably excellent, that the ſoul ſees infinite reaſon even in the <hi>Word</hi> it ſelf, to perſwade it that it is the Lords <hi>Word:</hi> Yea the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Written Word,</hi> ſpeaking the very Language it ſpeaks, favours ſo much of Heaven, that it appears to the Believing ſoul to be ſo Cloathed with Power, and Irreſiſtable Authority, it appears to have ſuch properties of God himſelf, peculiar unto God, Soul-Searching, Heart-Dividing, Properties finding out the Secrets of the Heart, that then the Believing ſoul
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:48673:265"/>
is Compaſſed about with Reaſon, Cloathed in with Reaſon, that appears ſhineing from the <hi>Word</hi> it ſelf, that ſatisfys the Believing Soul, that it is the <hi>Word</hi> of the Almighty Majeſty of Heaven: Divinity is then every way Ingraven upon the <hi>Written Word</hi> in the Believer: So that as the ſpirit in its caſting the Pretious Heavenly Light into the Beliving ſoul, did Write his own name upon thoſe Beams of light, and made them appear to the ſoul to be from the ſpirit; So likewiſe in the ſouls diſcerning the light alſo to proceed from the Lords <hi>Written Word,</hi> there is the name of God Written upon thoſe Beams of light al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that the ſoul knows as well as believes them to proceed from God himſelf, ſeeing they ſhine forth from that <hi>Word</hi> of his that the ſoul believes with Confidence, yea ſo Satisfyingly, and ſo knowingly to his full contentment, it is the <hi>Word</hi> of the Bleſſed Majeſty of Heaven. Would you know you that are Confident this day, that a light did ſhine into your ſouls to ſatisfy you concerning your union with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, whether this union be from God or no? Would you be aſſured as well to knowledge as to faith, that you are not deluded? Then ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that light that ſhined into your Souls have ſhined from the Lords written word. Yet let me add a caution in this, leaſt I might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſhake ſome Soul, into whoſe heart ſome beams of light from the Spirit hath really deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to diſcover to the Soul his union with Chriſt; though the light that doth ſhine into every Soul which truly proceeds from God, to diſcover to the Soul its union with Chriſt, doth and ought to ſhine forth from the Lords written word; yet I dare not affirm, that whenever the ſpirit of light
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:48673:266"/>
doth diſcover to a Soul its union with Jeſus Chriſt clearly, both to faith and ſenſe, that then the ſpirit faſtens ſome particular portions of the Lords word by name, from ſuch a Chapter and verſe, from whence the ſpirit doth make that light ſhine forth into that believing Soul; certainly the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Jeſus Chriſt may ſend down precious beams of divine light into a dark Soul, to diſcover to the Soul ſatisfyingly its union with the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, both to faith and ſenſe, when ſuch a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſentence that is written in ſuch a Book, in ſuch a Chapter, in ſuch a Verſe, is not brought to the Souls memory: But there may be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of the quinteſſence, that is, of the prime light, the moſt glorious light of many places of Scripture that concur together in one, to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the fame truth to the Soul: there may be an extract made by the Spirit of Chriſt, of the grand truth that the Goſpel reveals to faith, and of the truth of the Souls believing act that the ſpirit reveals unto the Souls ſenſe from many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, ſo as the light that the ſpirit cauſeth to ſhine into the Soul, is ſtill from the written word, and the ſoul diſcerns it to his own ſatisfaction, while the glory of the light actually remains, that it doth ſhine from the precious written word, though it may be the ſoul could not at that time be able to produce ſuch and ſuch particular ſentences, from ſuch a Chapter and ſuch a Verſe: though I dare not but ſay alſo, but as the ſoul receiving that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain evidence, doth diſcern that that ſweet light that ſhines into his ſoul, ſhines from the written word; ſo likewiſe upon recollecting of himſelf,
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:48673:266"/>
and upon ſerious deliberation with himſelf, he might be able to produce ſuch portions of the Lords word, as would ſufficiently teſtifie to the truth of what the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt had ſo revealed to his ſoul from the word: yet obſerve this, that the ſoul muſt then ſo deliberate, and ſo conſult with his heart about the matter, while the heavenly luſtre, and commanding pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of thoſe evidencing beams of light remain ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into his ſoul: for in caſe the ſoul be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved again upon any occaſion of the luſtre and glory of thoſe precious beams of light, the ſoul may ſo far forget the very ſentences that the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt did then dictate to it, that the ſoul through the darkneſs and obſcurity that paſſes upon him immediately again, may for the preſent be uncapable of diſcerning in the written word of God what his ſoul clearly diſcerned in the ſame word formerly, that the ſoul may (in caſe the ſpirit of light ſhould abſent it ſelf long) perchance begin to draw ſome ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that the evidence that the Soul received was not a light ſhining from the Lords word, but ſome deluſion from the Devil, transforming himſelf into Angelical Glory. This is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reaſon whence a ſoul may prove, that the beam of light received is from God when the ſoul diſcerns it to ſhine from the written word.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort of demonſtrations whereby a ſoul may prove to himſelf his union with Jeſus Chriſt, muſt be a demonſtration <hi>a poſteriori:</hi> A Demonſtration taken from the effects, that thoſe beams of light that ſhine into the ſoul, diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to a ſoul its union with Jeſus Chriſt, do
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:48673:267"/>
beget in the Soul. Now all the effects that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that proceeds from God begets in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Souls, are but the accompliſhment of the Lords eternal intent: they are but the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords precious thoughts of love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe believing Souls, <hi>from before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the world were laid.</hi> So that whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is communicated to any believing Soul, if it doth demonſtrate it ſelf to proceed from God, by its effects that it begets in him, it muſt then conduce in ſome degree to the effecting of the Lords precious eternal will towards that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul, Now thoſe eternal intents of God towards believing Souls; they may be reduced to three Heads according as the Spirit of truth ſums them in, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22, 23. <hi>All are yours, whether Paul or Apollo, or Cephas, or the World, or Life or Death, or things preſent, or things to come.</hi> That is Heaven and Earth; all are yours, that is deſtinated unto your good, to accompliſh your Salvation. <hi>And ye are Chriſts,</hi> that is, ye believing Souls are deſtinated to accompliſh the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>And Chriſt is Gods,</hi> that is Chriſt himſelf conſidered myſtically as the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, is appointed for the manifeſtation of the Fathers glory, for the exaltation of him in the hearts of Saints and Angels, and before the eyes of all the world, ſo as all may admire him and adore him,</p>
               <p>There are three intents and precious ends of the Lord from Eternity towards thoſe believing Souls.</p>
               <p>Firſt There is the accomplſhment of the glory of thoſe believing Souls</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="519" facs="tcp:48673:267" rendition="simple:additions"/>Secondly, The perfecting of Chriſts ſupernatural glory as he is Mediator.</p>
               <p>And Thirdly, The perfect manifeſtation of the Fathers glory through both theſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing theſe three are thoſe prime and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ends, the very ultimate end of God, the very ſum and compendium of all thoſe precious thoughts that wrought in the bleſſed Majeſty of Heaven, <hi>before the foundations of the world were laid;</hi> thence whatſoever proceeds from God into a believing ſoul muſt in ſome degree or other tend towards the accompliſhment of one of thoſe ends. So that it muſt demonſtrate it ſelf to proceed from God by one of thoſe three effects, if it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way can be proved by its effects to proceed from God himſelf. Only by the way you muſt take this diſtinction for prevention of miſtakes: the dealings of God towards the Saints, do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther immediately to the exaltation of the Saints, and the exaltation of Chriſt, and the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Fathers glory, or elſe they tend im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. The Lords promiſſive will, or the Lords ſufferance of a Believer to ſin, doth not immediately manifeſt any of theſe, yet mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it doth perfect all: that when the Lord doth ſuffer the ſoul to ſlide and fall, yet then through the mighty Power of his love to the believing ſoul in Chriſt, he doth ſend down the ſpirit of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, ſo to work in that believing ſoul, that thoſe very falls and ſlips, and backſlidings of that believing ſoul, ſhall produce more watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs over his own ways, more charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others, more abominations of thoſe cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed diſpoſitions in his own heart, more aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:48673:268"/>
thoughts of himſelf, as he is in himſelf, more diſtruſtful of himſelf and his own heart being leſs confident in himſelf, and in the ſtrength of the power of holineſs as yet communicated to him. And thus thoſe very falls or ſlips of that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoul, ſhall tend to their laſt end, to make the ſoul partaker of more holineſs, cauſing the ſoul to hang more intire, with a more precious conſtant dependance upon the Lord Jeſus, for the conſtant influences of the ſanctified ſpirit, and ſo ſhall exalt the name of God more in that heart, and ſo ſhall cauſe the ſoul to grow more into a conformity to that myſtical Head of his the Lord Jeſus; and ſo through that conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to his Head, and that myſtical glory of Chriſt, the glory of the Father ſhall be exalted. Thus likewiſe you muſt conſider again, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of God himſelf unto believing ſouls are ſecret, inviſible and inſenſible; and alſo they are viſible and ſenſible: Now thoſe communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions of God himſelf unto the believing ſoul that are viſible and ſenſible: thoſe do commonly immediately tend to the accompliſhment of the believing ſouls glory, that is, to the perfection of the likeneſs of Jeſus Chriſt in the ſoul, and ſo conſequently it tends alſo to the perfecting of Chriſts myſtical glory, and to the manifeſtation of the Fathers glory. But thoſe communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God unto a believing ſoul that are inviſible, ſecret and inſenſible, thoſe commonly do tend only mediately to the accompliſhment of thoſe fore named bleſſed ends. So that hence alſo
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:48673:268" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you may collect, that whenever any commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of God unto a believing ſoul, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate it ſelf to come from God, when it is ſenſible communication, then it doth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately tend to the accompliſhment of theſe three ends. This then being conſidered, and it being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that all the dealings of God with belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſouls are for the accompliſhment of thoſe his three bleſſed intendments from before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world was laid, then it muſt be through diſcerning of one of thoſe three intendments of God effected in the ſoul, that the believing ſoul muſt prove, that ſuch a beam of light as diſcovers to him his union with Chriſt, did proceed from God himſelf.</p>
               <p>Now we ſhall begin with the higheſt, and ſo proceed to the loweſt. <hi>All are yours, and ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods,</hi> that is for God. And from thence we may conclude, that the prime and principal reaſon taken from the effects of a ſouls union with Chriſt, (where by it may be proved, that ſouls evidence proceeds from God) is this, that the beam of heavenly light that ſhines into the ſoul, to diſcover its union with the Lord Jeſus, doth exalt and magnifie the name of God in the hearts. Gods exaltation of himſelf in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers heart, was the great deſign of God from all eternity: it was as it were the Alpha and Omega, (as I may ſo ſpeak) the very beginning and end of the Lords intention; only his intention reached fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to exalt himſelf through believing ſouls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other. Therefore then may the ſoul prove infallibly the light that diſcovered to his ſoul his union with Chriſt to proceed from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:48673:269" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when it effects the prime intendment of God from eternity to the believing Soul; when it erects a higher Throne from the Majeſty of Heaven in its heart, when it fills the heart with higher, lowder, more zealous acclamations of praiſe, and honour, and glory, and worſhip to be given for ever to yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God; that the light carries the ſtamp and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Heaven upon it, when it begins the work of Heaven in a believing way here: then it is an earneſt of Heaven, when it implys the Soul in the work that it is deſtinated to from Eternity, <hi>Pro.</hi> 19.6 God hath made all things for himſelf, that is, for the manifeſtation of his own tranſcendent glory, ſo for the magnifying of his ever bleſſed name. Now when the light that diſcovers to the ſoul its union, do thus effect Gods general, his ultimate end in the believing Soul, the Soul may certainly conclude, this beam of light did deſcend down from the Father of Lights. Now there are four or five acts in the believing Soul, wherein it exalts the name of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then the Soul exalts the name of God when it is filled with ſuch ſenſible apprehenſions of ſuch tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent brightneſs of glory ſhining ſorth from God, as the Soul is utterly unable to conceive of, or apprehend. Now this firſt act of that believing Soul, to exalt God in his heart, is the certain and infallible effect of every beam of light that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from God, to diſcover to his Soul his union with the Lord Jeſus: Indeed every act of the Lords mercy and goodneſs towards believing Souls, is a Precious, Chriſtal Glaſs, wherein believing Souls do ſee an incomprehenſibleneſs of the beauty, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and unſpeakable perfection of God; and
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:48673:269"/>
therefore much more unconceivable glory do the believing Soul apprehend, in ſuch an high act of the Lords mercy and love, as is the diſcovery of his precious eternal love to the believing Soul through Chriſt. This you ſhall ſee apparent in <hi>David,</hi> upon the Lords diſcovering of his promiſes made unto his Soul in Chriſt, and made unto his Houſe alſo, in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.18, 19, 20, 21. Then went King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in and ſat before the Lord: (then) that is after the Prophet had declared the precious promiſe to his Soul in Chriſt; and he ſaid, <hi>who am I O Lord God, and what is my Houſe, that thou haſt brought me hitherto? Thou art Great O Lord God, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beſides thee, ver.</hi> 22. Mark what ſenſible, high apprehenſions of a tranſcendent glory in God dwelt in <hi>Davids</hi> heart, upon the diſcovery of ſuch precious promiſes made to him and his Houſe; likewiſe upon a ſmaller mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy comparatively (though indeed typifying the ſame mercy) upon the deliverance of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from the hands of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and drowning their cruel Task-maſters in the Red Sea; the hearts of the Saints were filled with high apprehenſions of the glory of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.11, <hi>Who is like unto thee O Lord,</hi> (yea, they repeat their admiration twice, as if they could not admire him enough (<hi>who is like unto thee, glorious in holineſs, fearful in praiſes, doing wonders?</hi> you may behold the ſame workings of the believing heart, 1. <hi>John.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Behold what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that me ſhould be called the Sons of God.</hi> There are three or four ſpecial beams of the glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that a Believer apprehends as unſpeakable, unconceivable, incomprehenſible, when a beam
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:48673:270"/>
of light ſhines from God to diſcover to the Soul its union with Chriſt</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is then ſuch a glorious brightneſs of the preſence of God appears to the believing Soul, as it ſtands amazed to behold it. When the Lord lets ſuch a beam of light ſhine into the dark Soul, that it ſees the Lords will is indeed to be one with him in Chriſt; yea, that his Soul is already lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that precious boſom of the love of the Lord Jeſus, then the Soul beholds ſuch an unſpeakeable preciouſneſs in the Majeſty of Heaven, that he wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ſuch an unbeliever, ſuch a crooked op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite wretch ſo long, that the Soul ſets down ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to admire, and is ſwallowed to the depth in admiration.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a Soul amazing brightneſs appears in the Souls eye in the independance of the Lords love. When that bright Beam of light ſhines from Heaven, to diſcover to the Soul its union with the Lord Jeſus, the Soul ſeeth that there was nothing that moved the heart of God to have thoughts of love towards him, nothing that enclined his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed will to admit him into union with Jeſus Chriſt, but only his precious diſpoſition, only his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal thoughts of kindneſs, that old loving kindneſs of his from Eternity; then the Soul ſays as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.21. <hi>for thy words ſake, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy own heart haſt thou done all theſe great things, to make thy Servant know them;</hi> then the believing Soul ſays, though my wretched unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving heart could not truſt thee, yet for thy words ſake thou haſt fulfilled it, according to thine own heart thou haſt done it: O Lord, what could thy pureſt eye behold in this forlorn Soul of
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:48673:270" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mine? What could have moved the Lord thinks the Soul but his own bleſſed will, to chuſe ſuch an uſeleſs, ſuch an unſerviceable, ſuch an unprofitable, ſuch a barren ſuch a fooliſh; yea, ſuch a croſs hearted wretch as I?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The glorious irreſiſtible power of the Lords eternal love in Chriſt to the loveleſs Soul ſhineth gloriouſly. When once the light ſhineth from Heaven, that diſcovered to the believing Soul his union with Chriſt; how many curſed contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions thinks a believing Soul, did the love of Chriſt ſuffer from my Soul? How often did my vile believing heart give the Majeſty of Heaven the lye? How many years did I ſleight this? I ſtopped my Ears, I hearkned to none of his bleſſed tenders, yet then he bored mine Ear, and conſtrained me to hear: O think the Soul what a froward, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe hearted Wretch have I been to this dear God of mine. Certainly thinks the Soul, if rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if enmity, if the working of a Devils heart could have oppoſed it, it had been turned away from me.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The orient brightneſs of the Lords infallible truth ſhines before the Soul. Theſe Beams of the Lords glory ſhines in a peculiar manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Souls Eye; but there are multitudes of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Majeſty of Heaven, that alſo with theſe, ſhine in the ſame moment into the ſame Soul, when a light proceeds from God to diſcever to a Soul its union; then the wiſdom of the Lord in contriving the deſign of Redemption by Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, then do the very beauty of juſtice it ſelf appear, in the Lords contriving the Redemption of loveleſs Souls in ſuch a way, wherein juſtice and
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:48673:271" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mercy might meet together and kiſs each other; ſo that indeed a light ſhines from Heaven that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth the Soul round about, that the Soul ſtands amazed and aſtoniſhed, gazing upon thoſe beams of glory, that appear ſhining forth from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Heaven into his Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">II. A ſecond act of a believing Soul wherein the name of God is exalted in the Soul, is a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible apprehenſion, and eſtimation of the Lord to be infinitely worthy to receive all prefection of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and honour, and praiſe for ever. Now this precious God ſanctifying act, is alſo the infallible neceſſary effect of ſuch a precious beam of light, as doth truly ſhine from the Father of Lights into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Soul, to diſcover his union with the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. This was effected in <hi>Davids</hi> heart upon the Prophets diſcovering of the Promiſes made in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to him in 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.26 <hi>Let thy name be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified for ever, ſaying the Lord of Hoſts is the God over Iſrael;</hi> yea this act is infallibly produced in a believing Soul by every viſible motion of the Lords mercy or love towards the Soul. So you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.20. <hi>Miriam</hi> cried to the reſt of the Daughters of <hi>Judah; ſing ye to the Lord for he hath triumphed gloriouſly.</hi> So <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.10 11. <hi>The four and twenty Elders fell down that ſat before him upon the Throne; ſaying thou art worthy O Lord to receive glory and honour and power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now there are two things that follow upon the Souls viſion of his union with the Lord Jeſus, by the light of the Spirit of Chriſt that do neceſſarily produce this apprehenſion, or eſtimation in the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Upon the Souls diſcovery its union with the
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:48673:271" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lord Jeſus; there are lively enlarged actings of love produced in the Soul. Every renewed viſion of love inflames the Believers heart with love again correſpondently: Now from thoſe quickned and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged actings of love, do ariſe neceſſarily high eſtimations, and glorious conceptions of the Majeſty God, that thence the Soul apprehends him infinitely to receive honour and glory for ever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Upon the Souls diſcerning his union with the Lord Jeſus, there follows an apprehenſion of the ſouls union with the Lord Jeſus; there follows an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the Souls owing all that he is and enjoys unto God by way of retribution. Now from a Souls apprehenſion that he ows more then he is or have unto God, he conceives him infinitely worthy to receive honour and glory, for ever and ever from all the creation: he himſelf can never render glory ſufficient, therefore he eſteems it to be but equal, that the whole Creation ſhould joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to exalt this bleſſed Majeſty.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The third act in a believing Soul wherein the name of God is exalted, is a ſenſible apprehenſion of the diſpicableneſs, worthleſneſs and nothingneſs of the Soul it ſelf, and all that the circumference of the earth affords, without God and in compariſon of God. Now this God-exalting act in the believing Soul, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the neceſſary effect of ſuch a precious beam of light ſhining from the Father of Lights to diſcover to a Soul its union with Chriſt: then indeed is the Soul a worm and no man, then is he empty and poor, yea abſolutely nothing without communion with that his God; yea then is all the Creation but meer ſhadows, flying vanities without that God in Chriſt, then do the quinteſſence of all the beauty of the whole Creation
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:48673:272" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(if it could be abſtracted) appear but as the drop of the bucket, as the duſt of the ballance, yea as vanity without that God in Chriſt. Thus in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.4. upon the Pſalmiſts apprehenſion of the infinite glory of God, he immediately cries out into admiration of the nothingneſs of man, Lord what is man?</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The fourth act of the believing Soul wherein the name of God is exalted, is the Souls actual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration or ſubjections of all its powers and poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at the foot of the Lords glorious Majeſty. Now this precious God ſanctifying act in the believing Soul is the neceſſary infallible effect of a true beam of light ſhining from the father of lights into the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoul to diſcover its union with the Lord Jeſus. Indeed there is a neceſſity of ſuch a diſcovery to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Soul of its union with Jeſus Chriſt preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſweeteſt act of ſubjection of himſelf wholly at the foot of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard then when ſuch a light ſhines into the ſoul to diſcover its union with Chriſt, the ſoul apprehends an infinite diſproportion between that which he ows to God and his ability and capacity to pay to him, He apprehends Men and Angels are never ſufficient to render to the Lord according to his benefits beſtowed upon his loveleſs ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It appears to that ſoul (while there is ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of that his union with Chriſt) to be an infinite injury to the Majeſty of Heaven, that a thought of his heart ſhould not be ſubject to his bleſſed will. The heart ſaith within it ſelf, ſo ſweetly hath the Lord paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over himſelf and all his fulneſs, to this empty love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſoul of mine, that it were ſuch an accurſed requital as might incenſe the Lord to be incomplacable ſhould my heart be withheld from giving one ſubjection to him, that thence the ſoul is conſtrained by an irreſiſtble
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:48673:272"/>
power, by ineffable bands of love, to yield all precious ſubjection to the bleſſed will of God.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The fifth and laſt act, that muſt concurr together with all the Four former to the exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Name of God, is the ſouls taking up a full acquieſcenſe, or reſt and contentment in God alone. It is an infinite unſpeakable injury to the Majeſty of Heaven, that one deſire, one inclination in the heart, ſhould be a Vagrant to wander hither and thither to ſeek for its ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction out of God. Now this precious God-exalting act in the believing ſoul, is neceſſarily, certainly, and infallibly produced, by a true beam of light ſhining from Heaven into any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſoul, to diſcover its union with the Lord Jeſus. Thus you ſhall obſerve it was in <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 63.3, 4, 5. <hi>Thy loving kindneſs is better than life; My Soul ſhall be ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſs.</hi> It ſhould be contentment enough for him to enjoy his love only. Thus theſe Five acts which concur together to the exalting of the Lords bleſſed Name, are all the neceſſary and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain effects of a true beam of light ſhining from Heaven into the believing ſoul, to diſcover to it its union with the Lord Jeſus. So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Soul is partaker of ſuch a bleſſed beam of the light of Heaven, as do truly diſcover from God to him his union with the Lord Jeſus, he hath theſe pretious God-exalting acts neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily produced in his ſoul, whereby that light that ſhines into his Soul diſcovers it ſelf to have its original from God.</p>
               <p>There is a ſecond branch of this great end of God from eternity, from whence a Soul that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:48673:273"/>
he hath received ſatisfying evidences of his union with Chriſt, may gather another evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his union, and that is the exaltation of God through thoſe believing ſouls. This is that you read of, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>He hath choſen us in Chriſt before the foundation of the World, that we ſhould be holy, having predeſtinated us unto the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Children, through Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf, to the praiſe of the glory of his grace:</hi> That is, to the end that his glorious love in Jeſus Chriſt, might be made manifeſt through us, to give praiſe to the Lord, to declare the excellency of God, to publiſh and tell abroad the glory of God. Now the very end unto which God predeſtinated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Souls, was to the glory of his love, to the end they ſhould be like Silver Trumpets, to ſound aloud and proclaim his glory. So that then this being the great end of God from eternity, in his love to believing ſouls, that they might be like ſo many Golden Pillars, whereupon the Lord might write the glorious excellency of his love in great Characters, that others might read it; thence of neceſſity, this muſt be the effect and conſequence in ſome degree, of the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of love unto believing ſouls, all the workings of his love neceſſarily tending in order to their ultimate end. So that then a ſecond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, from whence the Soul may demonſtrate to himſelf, that the light that himſelf hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to diſcover to him his union with Jeſus Chriſt is really from God is this, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious light that ſhined into his dark ſoul to reveal to him his union with Chriſt, did neceſſarily and certainly effect the exaltation of God through him.
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:48673:273"/>
Now that exaltation of God conſiſts only in this, in the Souls declaring or manifeſting, the brightneſs and perfection of thoſe excellencies to be in God, that God hath revealed to be in him, in his pretious word. But herein we muſt deſcend down into particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, God is exalted through the Soul when the brightneſs, the luſtre, the perfection that the Lord diſcovers in that his love in Chriſt to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovely ſinners is manifeſted through the believing ſoul, and made conſpicuous before others by the believing ſoul. Thence it is you ſhall obſerve in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.23. ſaith God, <hi>who ſo offereth praiſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth me:</hi> Now the offering praiſe is nothing elſe taken ſtrictly, but a ſincere, humble declaration of the glorious workings of the Lords love and mercy to poor deſpicable worms; it is but a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the glorious works of God, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the excellency and perfection of God. Thence in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.7. The Sons and Daughters of God are ſaid to be Created for the Lords glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which they accompliſh by ſhewing forth his praiſe, <hi>v.</hi> 21. It is by making manifeſt what the excellencies of God in himſelf are. Now then God is exalted in a believing ſoul, when the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and glory of the Lords love in Chriſt revealed to Sinners, is made manifeſt through the Soul. This is done Three ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When the Soul doth give a real practical teſtimony to the fulneſs and perfection of that love of God in Chriſt to an unlovely Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Now this the believing ſoul doth practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally declare in Four or Five things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="532" facs="tcp:48673:274"/>Firſt, By rejoycing fully and gloriouſly in that love. When the Heart can rejoyce with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of glory, in that love of God that is in Chriſt, then is the bleſſed Name of God exalted through the ſoul, in regard the ſoul then declares practically, and gives a real teſtimony to other believing ſouls, and to the World too, that the bleſſed God of Heaven is true, that his love is according to what he declared in his bleſſed word, that his love to unlovely ſinners contains all kind of happineſs, contentment, glory and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency that is deſirable by a believing ſoul, ſo far as is ſuitable for him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When the Soul can deſpiſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard all kind of difficulty whatſoever, for the enjoyment of the ſweet fruit and working of that love of God that is in Chriſt. Thence it is that Martyrdom for the Name of Chriſt is accounted ſuch an high honouring of Jeſus Chriſt, and that the Lord teſtifies ſuch reſpect to thoſe that do ſuffer for his Name, in regard by thoſe their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings wherein they ſeem to ſlight their Eſtates, their outward Liberty, their Lives for the ſake of Chriſt; they declare there is all fulneſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in him, that there is happineſs enough for them, that all outward contentments, the confluence of all the happineſs that the Earth doth afford, is not to be compared to the enjoyment of the love of God in Chriſt, and to the pretious manifeſtation, and ſweeteſt operation of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When the Soul ſends forth the whole ſtrength of his ſoul in his purſuit of the enjoyment of the ſweeteſt diſcovery of that
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:48673:274" rendition="simple:additions"/>
love, and the moſt pretious operations of it into, and upon his ſoul.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, When there is a deadneſs in the Heart towards all things elſe, in compariſon of the love of God that is in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, When the ſoul can take its fulneſs of contentment in that love, in the abſence of all things elſe. When a ſoul can actually drink ſuch full drafts of the love of God that is in Chriſt; that is to ſay, promiſe himſelf ſuch happineſs contentment, unſpeakable perfection of glory, in the enjoyment of that love, that the Heart ſays practically it is enough; though the Heavens ſhould withdraw their light, and the Earth all her advantages that ever ſhe can afford, ſeeing there is the love of my God in Chriſt that I ſhall actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoy.</p>
               <p>Now further we are to ſhew you, that this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation, or declaration practically by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, that all perfection and glory is eminently contained in God in Chriſt to unlovely ſinners, is the neceſſary, certain, infallible effect of a beam of light ſhining from God to a believing ſoul, to diſcover its union with the Lord Jeſus. So that whenever any beam of light is caſt down from Heaven into the dark ſoul of any believer, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt certainly its union with the Lord Jeſus, then certainly alſo that ever bleſſed Name of God is exalted through the believing in that that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious beam of light doth neceſſarily cauſe that believer to manifeſt and declare practically, the fulneſs of the Lords love in Chriſt, that there is all perfection, excellency, and glory, that can poſſibly be ſuitable for the believing ſoul, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:48673:275"/>
in that love; eminently, tranſcendently, infallibly: as will appear further by opening e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular way and means, how the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoul doth practically manifeſt that there is fulneſs in the Lords love in Chriſt, to ſuch unlove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinners as the Lord declares. As,</p>
               <p n="1">I. The kind of fulneſs of joy and rejoycing, which is a prime and principal means how the name of God is exalted by a believing ſoul, is the neceſſary and infallible effect of a beam of light ſhining from Heaven into a ſoul to diſcover its union with the Lord Jeſus. That you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. <hi>whom having not ſeen ye love, in whom though now ye ſee him not, yet believing ye rejoyce with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory. [With joy unſpeakable.]</hi> Joy, that cannot be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered either by the Tongue of men or Angels; Joy it is full of glory; that is, full of excellency and ſweetneſs, delight and contentment: Their believing produced this effect, an unſpeakable joy in their Hearts; Then much more a beam of light from the ſpirit of light, diſcovering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to faith the Lords bleſſed will to admit the ſoul into union with Chriſt, and thereby pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully enabling the believing ſoul to believe afreſh, and alſo a beam of light from the bleſſed ſpirit, manifeſting the ſouls believing act unto the ſoul it ſelf (and ſo diſcovering both unto faith and ſenſe ſuch unſpeakable matter of joy and rejoycing) much more muſt this fill the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſoul with <hi>joy unſpeakable and full of glory.</hi> According to that in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.22, <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is peace and joy.</hi> Mark it, the proper ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt dwelling in the
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:48673:275" rendition="simple:additions"/>
believing ſoul is joy; then certainly that joy that poſſeſſes a believing ſoul, muſt needs be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly eminently raiſed to a high ſtrain, to a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative degree, when the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt ſhall dwell ſo plentifully as it doth, when it thus bears teſtimony to faith, and teſtimony to ſenſe, of the Souls union with Jeſus Chriſt. Yea, ſuch is the nature, and power, and vertue of a beam of light ſent down from God, to diſcover to a ſoul his union with Chriſt, that it cannot but infallibly produce ſuch a ſuperlative degree of joy and rejoycing in that love of God that is in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In regard through that beam of light from the ſpirit, and diſcovering to the Soul its union the enlarged, longing, reſtleſs breathings of that believing ſoul, are in ſome meaſure accompliſhed. Now <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.12. that the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of <hi>the deſire is a tree of life:</hi> There is ſuch infinite ſweetneſs, contentment and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the ſouls attaining his deſires, that from thence the ſoul ſeems to gather Apples of life from a Tree of life.</p>
               <p n="2">II. In regard that light gives the believing ſoul a pretious taſte of his mutual Communion with his God through Chriſt. Every believing act doth occaſion ſome Communion to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the believing ſoul, but much more in that believing act, that is heightned by the power of the ſpirit of Chriſt to a certainty: Then there are large degrees of life and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, communicated from God to the believing ſoul, and a kind of full communication of all the powers and poſſibilities of the believing ſoul
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:48673:276"/>
to God again: then God delights himſelf in the believing ſoul ſweetly, and the ſoul reciprocally delights himſelf in God. Now the very taſte of the communion, which is the earneſt of the ſouls full inheritance (which is eternal communion with God in Chriſt) that cannot but fill the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſoul with joy and peace.</p>
               <p n="3">III. In regard that light occaſions the believing ſoul to enjoy all that Heaven it ſelf can afford through hope. It cauſes the ſoul to ſit together with Chriſt by hope, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.6. It cauſeth the ſoul to diſcern certainly through believing the Lord Jeſus as his bleſſed head, to be gone before as an Harbinger to prepare a place for him, that the ſoul by hope ſits there already, and is ſaved alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That light draws out the actings of faith in ſuch certainty, that all the glory of Heaven it ſelf is preſented alſo to the believing ſoul. Faith, ſaith the Apoſtle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Is the evidence of things not ſeen;</hi> That is, it is ſuch a diſpoſition as by its pretious working, gives things not ſeen an evident certainty unto the believing ſoul: yea, it is the ſubſtance of things hoped for: The word in the original is very emphatical, it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, It is that which gives a ſubſtantial being to things hoped for; a being already, that the ſoul not only enjoys all that Heaven affords by hope, but through the certainty of the actings of faith (raiſed by the power of the Spirits working to diſcover to the ſoul its union with Chriſt) the ſoul enjoys all that Heaven affords at preſent: So that needs muſt a ſuperlative degree of joy poſſeſs the believing ſoul, when he in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:48673:276"/>
ſits in Heaven, as enjoying the ſweeteſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Lords love, as gazing upon that precious face of God in Chriſt, and bleſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo in the contemplation of it to all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond means by which the believing ſoul practically declares, that there is all perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and glory contained in the love of the Lord in Chriſt to unlovely ſinners, whereby the name of God is exalted through him, is the ſouls deſpiſing and diſregarding all difficulties for the enjoyment of that love of God in Chriſt. That is alſo the neceſſary, the infallible effect of a beam of light proceeding from the ſpirit of light, to diſcover to a ſoul his union with Chriſt. This you may obſerve, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34, 35. There you find the aſſuring act of faith concerning the ſouls union with Chriſt; <hi>who is he that condemneth, it is Chriſt that died?</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 37. You ſhall find the Apoſtle triumphing over all kind of difficulties, tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling under foot <hi>perſecution, neceſſity, famine, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, piril and ſword;</hi> and profeſſing, <hi>we are more than Conquerors</hi> over all, to overcome them, ſo as they are no impediment or hindrance to us, but we are able to be <hi>[more than Conquerors]</hi> to make advantage even of thoſe difficulties, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſhall the more cloſely purſue after Jeſus Chriſt. Yea, ſuch is the power of that light that diſcovers to the ſoul its union with Chriſt, that it doth neceſſarily cauſe the ſoul thus to deſpiſe all difficulties for the enjoyment of the love of God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="539" facs="tcp:48673:277"/>1. In regard that light enobles and raiſes the ſpirit, of every one to whom the ſpirit of light communicates it. Heirs views of their great Poſſeſſions, greatens their Spirits: likewiſe do the believing ſouls viſion of thoſe glorious things prepared for them, heighten and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate their Spirits above all things below.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard the pretious light from the fpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of light, doth preſent ſuch unparalled, ſuch incomprehenſible glory to the believing ſouls view, that all things appear as nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of <hi>that glory that is revealed.</hi> Now thence it cannot be but difficulties muſt appear as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon the ſight of ſuch glory; hence <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Heb.</hi> 11.26. diſregarded <hi>Pharoahs</hi> wrath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaw God that was inviſible; and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calls the afflictions they met with <hi>light affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> becauſe they looked at <hi>things that were not ſeen,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, 18.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard it doth neceſſarily produce en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, enlivening actings of love. Every belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving act produces a proportionable act of love; Therefore certainly that high noble act of faith, that act of certainty that is drawn forth by the ſpirit of light at ſuch a time, doth produce enlarged acts of love, it proportionably doth ſend out the ſtrength of the ſoul in love towards God in Chriſt, as well as the ſtrength of the ſoul goeth out in believing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third means whereby the ſoul practically declares that there is a fulneſs of the Lords love whereby the Lord is exalted in the ſoul, is the ſouls purſuance with his utmoſt ſtrength, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the cleareſt viſions of that love, and
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:48673:277" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the ſweeteſt freedom of the actings and workings of that love into, and towards the ſoul. Now this alſo is the neceſſary effeſt of a beam of light coming down from Heaven, to evidence or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal to a ſoul his union with Chriſt. You ſhall obſerve in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1, 2, 4. That Souls certainty of their union with Chriſt, which was the effect of the ſpirit of light ſhining into their hearts, it did produce ſuch groaning and longing with the ſtrength of their Souls, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the ſweeteſt and cleareſt enjoyment of the fulneſs of that love: We know ſaith he (there is the act of certainty) <hi>that if our earthly Houſe of this Tabernacle be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, we have a building of God, an Houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens:</hi> Mark, <hi>for this we groan earneſtly, deſiring to be cloathed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with our Houſe which is from Heaven:</hi> So <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>we groan, being burdened;</hi> and ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>they were willing to abſent from the body, and to be preſent with the Lord:</hi> The ſtrength of their Souls ſo purſued after the fulleſt, the cleareſt enjoyment of that love, that they deſired to breath out their lives, to be diſſolved, that they might have the cleareſt viſion of that love of God in Chriſt, and the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enjoyment of it. Neither can it poſſibly be otherwiſe, conſidering,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that things appear in their deſpicable nothingneſs, by ſuch a beam of light ſhining from the bleſſed Spirit into a believing Soul, to diſcover its union. Thence it is that the ſtrength of the ſoul purſues after the enjoyment of the love of God in Chriſt only, ſeeing no other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject appears worthy to be deſired in compariſon to the enjoyment of the love of God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="540" facs="tcp:48673:278"/>2. In regard the love of God in Chriſt, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by that light, appears in ſuch a manner as takes up the whole intention of the believing Soul, and implies every faculty of it. Such a myſtery appears in that fulneſs of the love of God in Chriſt to unlovely ſinners, as takes up all the ſtrength of the Souls capacity to view and meditate upon; yea, it at laſt appears to be a depth never to be fathomed, and ſo drowns the underſtanding in a depth of admiration; yea, that fulneſs of the Lords love appears ſo to comprehend all beauties, and glories, and all things deſirable, as it is the object of every deſire, of every motion, or reaching forth of the Spirit: So that thence it takes up all the intentions of all the faculties of the Soul.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. A Fourth means whereby believing Souls do declare the Lords love to be according as the Lord reveals, whereby the Name of God is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in the Soul, is the deadneſs of the Heart to every thing in compariſon to that love of the Lord in Chriſt. Now even this crucifying of the Heart to all things elſe in compariſon of that love, is the infallible effect alſo of ſuch a beam of light from the Spirit of God to reveal to the Soul its union. That 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. is enough to manifeſt it. Their certainty of their acceptance with God, produced a willingneſs in them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be abſent from the body it ſelf, a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs in their Hearts to part with every thing for the enjoyment of that love, it choaked and quenched all deſires of earthly objects of beauty or excellency, ſo as their Spirits were
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:48673:278" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo dead, ſo void of deſire, ſo empty of all thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and endeavours after earthly objects, as they rather deny to be diſſolved, to be dead indeed that they might have the full benefit of their union, even the full preſence of God in Chriſt. And certainly it cannot be, but ſuch a light from the Lord to diſcover to the Soul its union with Chriſt, muſt neceſſarily thus Crucifie the Heart to all things, ſo as to be alive to God in Chriſt only, both in regard the Soul apprehends the doleful, ſinful miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of his Heart about every of thoſe things (what ſad ſnares they are to his Spirit) and alſo he beholds the emptineſs and nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by comparing things temporal, with things eternal; and he beholds a full object of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, wherein all the deſires of his Soul may be concerned together in one, wherein is all happineſs that his Spirit can breath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and he may bleſs himſelf in the full enjoyment of it.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The Fifth means whereby the Soul expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally manifeſts the fulneſs of the Lords love, ſo as the name of God is exalted through him, is the fulneſs of contentment that the Soul takes in the enjoyment of the love of God in Chriſt only, in the abſence of all things elſe. Now even this alſo is produced by ſuch a light evidencing to the Soul his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Lord Jeſus; yea, ſo powerful is this contentment of the Heart in the love of God in Chriſt in the abſence of all things elſe, effected by ſuch a light of Heaven, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:48673:279"/>
to the Soul his union with Chriſt, that the Soul while the beauty and luſtre of that light remains, takes not only its full contentment, but even more than contentment, even glorying in his God in Chriſt, in the want of all things. That you may ſee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, 2. <hi>Being juſtified hy faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, but <hi>we glory in tribulation alſo: We glory,</hi> that is, we make our boaſt of God, we bleſs our ſelves in him, we are able to ſet the love of God in oppoſition to all things elſe, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in tribulations themſelves to triumph and glory, to conceive our ſelves ſo filled with excellence, that we even boaſt our ſelves of him. So that thus all thoſe precious acts of a believing ſoul, whereby he declares and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts the fulneſs of the Lords love in Chriſt to unlovely ſinners (ſo as the Name of God is exalted through the Soul by that means) all thoſe acts are neceſſarily and infallibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the power of that light from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that doth diſcover to any Soul his union with the Lord Jeſus. And ſo it appears, that this may be a ſecond reaſon from whence a believing Soul may prove, that the evidence of his union with the Lord Jeſus received, is really from God, becauſe it cauſeth the Name of God to be exalted through him. Thus we have opened the firſt way of the Souls ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of that glorious love to be in God, that God hath revealed to be in himſelf, that is, by the Souls manifeſting that unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fulneſs to be in the love of God in Chriſt
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:48673:279"/>
to deſpicable ſinners, that all perfections and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious excellencies whatever that could be ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a Soul is compleatly contained in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, A Soul doth manifeſt that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous love to be in God, which God hath reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be in himſelf unto deſpicable Sinners; By diſcovering or manifeſting ſuch an abſolute perfection to be in that love of God in Chriſt, to unlovely Sinners, as nothing can prevent and hinder, or turn away that love. When a Soul ſhall declare, that the infinite multitudes of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, that his Soul heaped up before his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God in Chriſt, and all the infirmities and imperfections that abound in his Soul now, yet are no hindrance to the working of the Lords love in Chriſt to his unlovely Soul; yea, when the Soul ſhall triumph againſt imperfections as <hi>Paul</hi> did againſt tribulation, and ſay apparently, who ſhall ſeparate this loathſome Soul of mine, from that pretious love of God that is in Chriſt Jeſus? Shall my deadneſs, hardneſs, vanity, looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Shall my ſtubborn, oppoſite, backſliding diſpoſition, my hopocritical, falſe, treacherous diſpoſition, ſeparate this loveleſs Soul of mine, <hi>from the love of God that is in Chriſt;</hi> Nay, in all theſe infirmities, and imperfections, the love of the Lord in Jeſus Chriſt never ceaſes its working: Nay, ſo glorious is the freedom of that love of God in Chriſt, that it breaks through all ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, as my vileſt Heart makes againſt it; Then is the Name of God exalted in the glory of his love through the Soul. Thus did <hi>Paul</hi> exalt God, when he had been acknowledging, <hi>that in him;</hi> that is, <hi>in his fleſh dwelt no good thing,</hi> Rom.
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:48673:280"/>
7.8. That not a ſpark, not a diſpoſition, not an inclination to comply with the Lords bleſſed will dwelt in him, and declares the mighty ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Law of his members (which were the curſed diſpoſitions of his Heart) againſt the Law of his mind (which was the bleſſed diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his Heart to comply with God) when thus I ſay he declared that the Law that was in his members was ſo full of power and might, that it maintained a ſtrong battel againſt Jeſus Chriſt; yea, that it wounded him, and made him a Slave and Vaſſal to that curſed diſpoſition, yet then he exalts God by this occaſion, breaking out thus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> Mark that word <hi>now:</hi> Now ſeeing the vile, rebellious diſpoſition of my vileſt Heart, cannot turn away the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Lords free love; now ſeeing though my Heart maintain War againſt the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt; yea, ſuch War as leads my Soul Captive alſo, and even enſlaves and enthrals, and vaſſalageth me under the power of ſin; though it be thus, yet the love of God in Jeſus Chriſt can never ceaſe it workings. He thus declares to the whole World in a kind of triumphing way, that the freedom of Gods love is ſo abſolute and perfect; that even now, though there be ſuch oppoſition made againſt the workings of it, by the vileſt crooked Heart, yet there can never be a turning away of that love, never a Sentence of Condemnation drawn out by God againſt any Soul that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts that his love in Chriſt. This manifeſtation, that there is ſuch an abſolute perfection of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:48673:280"/>
in the love of God in Chriſt, that nothing can prevent and turn away that love from any ſoul that embraceth it, this is manifeſted three ways, through which the name of God is exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through the Soul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is manifeſted by the ſouls ſenſible free acknowledgement of its abhorred vileneſs and loathſomneſs, when the Lord tenders his love in Chriſt to it; yea when the Lord receives his unlove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Soul into the deareſt, ſweeteſt embrace of his love. When the ſoul ſhall readily and freely declare, nothing but enmity, oppoſition, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the bleſſed God of Heaven, to have been in his vileſt heart, when that bleſſed news came down from Heaven to his hopeleſs Soul, that the Lord was ready and willing to admit of reconciliation, peace and agreement and love, to be between his ſoul and himſelf. This indeed is a high exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the name of God in reſpect of the glory of that his love that he reveals to be in himſelf to ſuch unlovely ſinners; when thus the ſoul ſhall declare to the everlaſting honour of God, that true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is his word; he loves upon his own will only, and ſhews mercy to whom he will, and becauſe he will. And thence you may obſerve, that it is a high diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to the name of the bleſſed God, for any ſoul to make any claim to that love of God that is in Jeſus Chriſt, by vertue of any quality or diſpoſition whatever, that is in their own ſouls, whereby they are differenced as they conceive from other ſouls, and they have right to claim that love of God in Chriſt when other ſouls may not claim it; this is a pollution of the name of God, by its vilifying the abſolute perfection of freedom in the love of God
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:48673:281" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in Chriſt to unlovely ſinners.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The manifeſtation of the glory of the Lords love to the exaltation of God through the ſoul, is by the ſouls unwavering, unſhaken confidence in the truth and faithfulneſs of the Lord according to his word, to admit the ſoul into the ſweeteſt Boſom of his love in Chriſt, notwithſtanding all the loathſomneſs and forlornneſs of the worthleſs ſoul. When the ſoul manifeſts his confidence in that faithfulneſs of God in the higheſt degree, then is the name of God exalted through the ſoul, when the ſoul ſays with <hi>Paul.</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>I know whom I have truſted;</hi> notwithſtanding all this, the wretched and moſt accurſed wickedneſs of my vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt heart, <hi>I know he is true and faithful,</hi> he will let his love that is, in Jeſus, work according as he hath diſcovered it freely from the diſpoſition of his own will only, notwithſtanding all my wickedneſs. And mark it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, this one of the prime reaſons, why Jeſus Chriſt in that pattern of all prayer that he hath freely given us (commonly called the Lords Prayer) hath commanded all ſouls and ſo believing ſouls, to pray conſtantly for forgiveneſs of their Treſpaſſes, for pardon of ſin, becauſe through that act performed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will of Jeſus Chriſt, the name of God is conſtantly exalted through the believing ſoul. I do believe that pleading for pardon of ſin by believing ſouls is much miſtaken; ſome ſouls darkly and blindly (I had like to have ſaid ſuperſtitiouſly) plead for the uſe of thoſe very words, <hi>forgive us our treſpaſſes,</hi> as though no believinng ſoul could perform his duty without the repetition of thoſe words and other ſouls from an abhorrency
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:48673:281" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the blindneſs and darkneſs of thoſe that thus plead for the uſe of the bare words, utterly reject that Petittion that Jeſus Chriſt hath given us, as a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern whereby to frame our Petitions, determining it utterly unlawful to make ſuch a Petition, or ſuch a Requeſt; but certainly were the reaſon of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the requeſt rightly conſidered, it might give light both to the one and to the other, to give them to conceive aright, how and why a believing ſoul may pray and beſeech the Lord to pardon his Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, though underſtanding through believing that they are already pardoned. There are two things that muſt concur together for the making of that requeſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt is a remembring the Lord of his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſe wherein he offers reconciliation, peace and love in Chriſt to the ſinful deſpicable ſoul. There muſt be in the thoughts of the believing ſoul ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the requeſt aright, an actual apprehenſion that God hath offered unto his ſoul reconcliation by Chriſt, and ſo remiſſion of all his ſins freely by Chriſt; and queſtionleſs there ought to be ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring of that promiſe alſo before the Lord, though ſometimes more briefly, ſometimes more largely, ſometimes in one manner, ſometimes in another; yet a remembring of the Lord <hi>of</hi> that his precious word.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there muſt be a ſincere deſire in the believing ſoul, that his heart and mind might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the truth of the Lords word, as ſpoken to his particular ſoul; and conſequently a deſire to truſt to the truth and faithfulneſs of the Lord to fulfill that his precious word even to his particular ſoul fully, So that the ſoul that preſents the requeſt
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:48673:282"/>
a right, muſt upon the apprehenſion of his own moſt accurſed vileneſs, turn his eye to that ſweeteſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of reconciliation and peace to his ſoul in Chriſt, ſaying ſecretly at leaſt, O Lord thou haſt ſpoken it, that thy will is to remit the ſins, to paſs by the enmity of every rebellious ſoul that will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the reconciliation thou doſt tender in Chriſt, and then the heart muſt proceed farther, ſaying O Lord ſeeing thou haſt ſpoken it, fulfill that thy word to this rebellious ſinful ſoul of mine, my ſoul deſires to truſt to thy truth to fulfill it, O let it be fulfilled, let that enmity be removed, and that reconciliation be eſtabliſhed between thee and my ſoul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third way of the ſouls manifeſtation of the perfection of freedom that is in the love of God in Chriſt to deſpicable ſinners, by which the name of God is exalted through the ſoul, is by the ſouls maintaining the ſame confidence of his in the Lords truth to vouchſafe to be in love with his unlovely ſoul through Chriſt, notwithſtanding all infirmities, weakneſs, imperfections and perverſe crookedneſs that his heart ſhall diſcern a freſh to be in himſelf. Now when the ſoul after humble acknowledgement of thoſe curſed diſpoſitions in his corrupt heart, ſhall ſtill act and manifeſt that precious confidence, then doth the ſoul give glory to the Lord in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the freedom that is in his love, then doth the ſoul declare that nothing can turn away, or cauſe to ceaſe the workings o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that infinite free love of God in Chriſt, then the ſoul declares that the love of God in Chriſt was built upon no other foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but his precious will, and that it was nothing in the ſoul that was lovely and amiable in the eyes of
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:48673:282"/>
God, that ever inclined the heart of God to ſix his love upon the ſoul. And on the contrary, thence it is that thoſe ſouls pollute the name of God in their hearts, and before others alſo, whoſe confidence ſhake and waver upon the ſight of every new infirmity and imperfection, whoſe confidence is caſt away upon the ſight of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very new crooked diſpoſition working in their hearts, upon every diſpoſition to deadneſs, vanity, looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: by this they vail the abſolute perfection of the riches of the freedom of love that is in God through Chriſt to unlovely ſinners, and declare in effect the love of the Lord in Chriſt to be built upon the holy actings of the foul towards God; yea the ſoul declares in effect (vertually at leaſt) that the riches of the Lords love that is in Chriſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and diminiſh, according to the holineſs or unholineſs that he diſcerns in his own heart. Hence the Apoſtle exhorts believing fouls upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>count of Chriſts interceſſion, to come boldly to the Throne of Grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15.16 <hi>That the name of God might be exalted through believing ſouls,</hi> by holding forth the glorious freedom of that rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of love that is in Chriſt Jeſus. Now we ſhall ſhew you that this exaltation of God in this manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the perfection of freedom of his love in Chriſt to unlovely ſinners, is the neceſſary inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, infallible effect of a true beam of light ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from Heaven into any dark heart, to reveal to that ſoul his union with the Lord Jeſus. This muſt be opened by ſhewing you thoſe three acts of believing ſouls, whereby they do thus manifeſt the glorious freedom of the Lords love to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of God through them; that theſe three
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:48673:283"/>
acts are neceſſarily and certainly produced in ſouls by diſcerning a beam of light from Heaven to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to them their union with Jeſus Chriſt</p>
               <p>Firſt, That ſenſible and free acknowledgement of the ſouls abhorred vileneſs, even when the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Lords love in Jeſus Chriſt is made to it; yea when the Lord graſps it in the everlaſting arm of his love that was in Chriſt, even this ſenſible and free acknowledgement of the ſouls moſt curſed wickedneſs, is the neceſſary effect of a ſouls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a light from Heaven, to evidence its uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, this you may ſee, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that he was before a <hi>Blaſphemer,</hi> and a <hi>Perſecutor,</hi> and <hi>injurious,</hi> yet to me the grace of our Lord was exceeding abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, not only abundant, having more than a fulneſs of love, but exceeding abundant, abounding in the moſt ſuperlative degree, in the moſt inconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable manner. So the third and fourth Chapters to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſeem to be written for that very purpoſe in a great meaſure, to prove nothing but vileneſs to have been in thoſe ſouls whom the Lord accepted into the Boſom of his love in Chriſt. Thus the Apoſtle endeavours to draw forth free acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments of their abhorred vileneſs, while he is remembring them of the riches of the Lords love in Chriſt to them. We ſhall make it appear in ſome particulars, that the free ſenſible acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the ſouls abhorred wickedneſs, when the Lord tenders his love in Chriſt, is the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary effect of receiving a beam of light from Heaven to diſcover to the ſoul his union.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard there is an actual view of the moſt accurſed wretchedneſs of the ſoul, by the power
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:48673:283"/>
of a beam of light that ſhines from Heaven to diſcover to a ſoul his union with Chriſt. Any beam of true light that ſhines into a ſoul, is but a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Goſpel meſſage in its clearneſs, extent and latitude; it is but an opening and expounding clearly and ſatisfyingly to the ſouls capacity the meſſage of glad tydings that Chriſt ſent to poor deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable ſinners: now that glad tydings, is nothing elſe but the meſſage of reconciliation to every ſoul that will accept it, and thence it cannot be but the ſame light muſt preſent to the ſouls view the ſight of his enmity and oppoſition of heart; it can not be but at the ſame moment when the ſoul ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends his own reconciliation to God in Chriſt, he muſt apprehend his own enmity formerly to God in Chriſt. Thence it is that in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31. In the Prophets foretelling the bleſſed Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, that ſhould be eſtabliſhed between God and Souls, he doth alſo prophecy that thoſe with whom the Covenant of Grace ſhould be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; they ſhall remember their own evil ways and doings that were not good, and ſhall loath themſelves in their own ſight for their iniquities and abominations. Now any beam of precious light from Heaven, thus neceſſarily preſenting to the ſoul an actual view of its own abhorred vileneſs, thence it cannot but diſpoſe that believing ſoul for ſenſible and free acknowledgement of that unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vileneſs of his, when the tender of that love came to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard every beam of light enables the ſoul to comprehend his ſinfulneſs and moſt accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed wickedneſs more largely and fully, it cauſeth him to behold the height and depth, and length
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:48673:284"/>
and breath of his own wickedneſs according to the glory of God apprehended againſt whom the ſoul have ſinned; ſo are the ſouls apprehenſions or comprehenſions of the height of his own vileneſs; now the glory of the light never ſhines ſo clearly and tranſparently upon any ſoul, as it does when ſuch a beam of light comes from the ſpirit of light and manifeſtation, to diſcover the glorious riches of love in Chriſt to the diſpicable unlovely ſoul, admitting the loveleſs, worthleſs ſoul into the neareſt union; ſo that thence there can never be ſuch full comprehenſions of his own ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as there is in the very moment when ſuch a beam of light ſhines from Heaven upon the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard the affections are all drawn forth to work in their ſtrength againſt the ſouls ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by ſuch a beam of light ſhining forth. That manifeſtation of the riches of the Lords love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets anſwerable correſpondent workings of love in the ſoul towards God again: now thoſe workings of love in the ſoul towards God, draws forth the workings of all the other affections againſt the ſouls ſinfulneſs. Love and Hatred works towards their contrary objects in like degree: In the very ſame meaſure that the actings of love are drawn out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, in the ſame meaſure is the hatred of the ſoul, the loathing and abhorring of the ſinful diſpoſition drawn out. This <hi>David</hi> declares, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.103. That upon his taſting the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lords words which were the actings of love in the ſoul of <hi>David</hi> to the word of God, <hi>he hates every falſe way, ver.</hi> 104. <hi>and vain thoughts ver.</hi> 13. His love and hatred wrought equally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like towards their object, his love to the Law of
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:48673:284"/>
God made him hate whatever was contrary to it. Now the love of the ſoul towards God, is drawn out in its ſuperlative degree of acting by that clear diſcovery from Heaven that Jeſus Chriſt and the Soul are one: and thence likewiſe all the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cannnot but work in their higheſt degree againſt all the ſinfulneſs of the Soul, both hatred of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſpoſition, ſorrow and melting and breaking of heart in remembrance of it, anger, diſpleaſure and indignation againſt it, fear and dread of thoſe iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties having power over it. Now thence it cannot be but the ſame beam of light diſcovering to the Soul his union with Chriſt, ſhould neceſſarily produce ſenſible and free acknowledgement of the Souls ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred vileneſs, ſeeing it fills the heart with the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſtrong affection againſt his own ſinfulneſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In regard, there are conſtant actings of faith in the believing Soul, while the glory of ſuch a beam of light from Heaven ſhines into the Soul. There are ſuch renewed operations of ſaith continues, while that light ſhines into a Soul that diſcovers his union with Chriſt, that there ſeems (during the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that light into the Soul) to be but one exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded drawn forth act of faith. Now ſeeing there are thoſe conſtant actings of ſaith, there cannot alſo but be conſtant veiws of the Souls moſt abhorred wickedneſs: the Soul by an act of faith veiwing the reconciliation wrought by Chriſt for him, it cannot alſo but veiw the enmity of his Soul againſt God in Chriſt; ſo that from the conſtant veiw of the Souls vileneſs, there cannot but be ſenſible abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of that vileneſs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In regard the admiration of the glory of the
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:48673:285"/>
Lords love in Chriſt, fills the Soul with a conſtant ſenſe of its own baſeneſs. The Soul cannot be ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the admiration of that love, but it muſt ſit down and admire and wonder: now the Soul can never wonder at that love as it is manifeſted, but it muſt take in it ſelf as the object of that love, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is that the glory of that love ſhines forth ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely; the Soul cannot but ſay who am I, what could the Lord diſcern in me, that ſuch riches of love ſhould work towards me? So that thence the heart (during the continuance of that light that ſhined from Heaven to diſcover its union) is kept conſtantly working againſt his own vileneſs, and from the conſideration of his vileneſs, the Soul proceeds to a ſenſible acknowledgement thereof.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In regard ſuch a precious beam of light doth neceſſarily produce a dear tenderneſs in the heart towards the honour of God; yea it produceth an infinite contentment and delight in the Soul to be exalting God. Now the Soul cannot be exalting the name of God in that way of his mercy towards him, but he muſt begin with the ſenſe of his own abhorred wretchedneſs, towards whom ſuch mercy hath been diſcovered: he can never ſpeak of the glory of the Lords love in Chriſt, but he muſt alſo ſpeak of the wretchedneſs and wickedneſs of himſelf towards whom that love works, otherwiſe the Soul vails the glory of the love of God in Chriſt. So that hence alſo neceſſarily proceed ſenſible acknowledgements of the Souls accurſed wretchedneſs, whenever a a beam of light ſhines from Heaven to diſcover to a Soul his union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſecond way of manifeſtation of the perfection of the freedom of the Lords love,
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:48673:285"/>
which is by the Souls manifeſting an unwavering confidence in the faithfulneſs of the Lord to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe the ſweeteſt embraces of love to the loveleſs Soul, notwithſtanding all its wretchedneſs. Even this is the conſtant, certain and infallible effect of a beam of light ſhining from Heaven to diſcover to the Soul its union with Chriſt. This you may obſerve, in 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8. The Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, <hi>they had received the earneſt of the Inheritance, they had received a pawn from Heaven, a pledge of everlaſting communion with God in Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we are always confident, willing rather to be abſent from the Body and preſent with the Lord.</hi> So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. <hi>Thoſe that had received the firſt fruits of the ſpirit, did groan after the full redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Bodies;</hi> in the mean time being filled with holy confidence, as you may obſerve, <hi>ver.</hi> 33.34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?</hi> (ſpeaking in the Perſons of thoſe that had received the firſt fruits of the ſpirit) <hi>who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt thas died? who ſhall ſeparate us from the Love of Chriſt?</hi> And indeed this cannot but be the neceſſary effect of the ſpirit of light revealing to the Soul its union with Jeſus Chriſt; ſeeing the rock of everlaſting certainty, whereupon the Soul may build the hopes of the riches of the Lords love in Chriſt towards him, is revealed by the ſpirit of light revealing to the Soul its union. For you know the prime way of the ſpirt of light revealing to the Soul its union, is by revealing to the Souls faith, that it is the will of the Lord to admit that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Soul into union with Jeſus Chriſt; yea the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould not execute its office in revealing to the Soul its union, ſhould it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:48673:286" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Soul in an unwavering confidence (while that light remains) of enjoying the ſweeteſt embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Lords love, notwithſtanding all its vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The third act of the Soul, whereby it manifeſts the perfection of the love of God to unlove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinners, which is by the ſouls manifeſting its ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs in the ſame confidence, of the fulneſs of the Lords love in Chriſt working towards it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſenſe of new infirmitie, imperfection, crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs; even that is alſo the certain, neceſſary effect of the ſpirit of light diſcovering to the Soul its union with Jeſus Chriſt. This you may obſerve in that 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>They were ſenſible of their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection while they were in the Body;</hi> yet they were nevertheleſs confident, <hi>having received the earneſt of the ſpirit,</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23 compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Paul though he fought new Combates, though he were never led captive by the law of his members</hi> yet notwithſtanding he was confident that there was no condemnation, no ſentence of vengeance, or dictate of juſtice, that could paſs out againſt his Soul, that was now admitted into union with the Lord Jeſus And this indeed cannot but be the neceſſary effect of a beam of light ſhining from God to manifeſt unto the Soul its union with Jeſus Chriſt, ſeeing that beam of light firſt diſcovers the Lords bleſſed unchangeable will, to be the only foundation of that love of God in Chriſt. Thus when the glory and luſtre of the light continues, the ſenſe of the Souls weakneſs, ſinful diſpoſition, imperfection, cannot ſhake the Souls confidence, in regard of that clear apprehenſion that then poſſeſſes the Soul, that there is nothing in that Soul that is the foundation of that
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:48673:286"/>
love of God in Jeſus Chriſt that he hopes for: and in regard alſo a dear apprehenſion poſſeſſes the Soul; that there are the ſame motives and arguments in the boſom of that ever bleſſed God of love, yet to love that unlovely Soul notwithſtanding his new infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, his new backſliding diſpoſition or proneneſs to backſliding. Now ſuch a manifeſtation of the ſtedfaſtneſs in the confidence of the Soul under the ſenſe of new infirmities, cannot but be the effect of ſuch a beam of light, in regard the unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the will of God that is revealed, to admit the Soul into union with God in Chriſt, is clearly revealed by the power of that light; ſo that while the beauty and glory of that light continues, though new corrupt diſpoſitions ariſe in the believing Soul, yet the confidence of the Soul ſhakes not, becauſe it is built upon the faithfulneſs of God, in fulfilling his bleſſed will to the Soul, which will of his is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. So that then it is apparent, that the name of God is exalted through every believing Soul in the glorious freedom of his love that is in Jeſus Chriſt to unlovely ſinners, by and through the ſpirits diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery to the Soul certainly his union with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">III. A Soul doth manifeſt the glorious perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords love in Chriſt to worthleſs, unlovely ſinners, by manifeſting ſuch an abſolute perfection of the love of God in Chriſt to ſinful Souls, as that love is ſubject to no variation, alteration or ſhadow change. When the Soul ſo walks, as he declares practically, that the rich love of God in Chriſt to his unworthy Soul, <hi>is the ſame yeſterday and to day and the ſame for ever; the foundation thereof ſtanding firm and unmoveable, like Mount Sion that cannot be
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:48673:287"/>
moved:</hi> then doth the brightneſs of the Lords glorious love ſhine through the Soul, ſo as the name of God is exalted through it. Thus God glorified himſelf before the eyes of <hi>Balak</hi> through the mouth of the falſe Prophet <hi>Balaam,</hi> to give teſtimony to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs of the love of God in Chriſt to his People <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by ſending that meſſage to <hi>Balaam, Numb.</hi> 23.19. <hi>God is not a man that he ſhould lye, neither the ſon of man that he ſhould repent</hi> (that is, not like the ſons of men that his thoughts ſhould change) <hi>what he hath ſpoken ſhall it not come to paſs?</hi> His words concerning his People ſhall certainly be fulfilled. So likewiſe when the Lord by the mouth of the Prophet <hi>Malachie,</hi> intended to lift up his name in his Peoples hearts, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6. he diſcovers to them his precious thoughts of love concerning them, in declaring the coming of Jeſus Chriſt with the bleſſed effect of it, and ſaith he, <hi>I am the Lord, I change not, therefore the Sons of Jacob are not conſumed.</hi> So the Church exalts the name of God, by bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the unchangeableneſs of his love to her, <hi>Lament</hi> 3.22.22. <hi>It is of the Lords mercy that we are not conſumed, becauſe his compaſſion fail not.</hi> Now a Soul manifeſts the unchangeableneſs of the Lords love in Chriſt to his unworthy Soul by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and unmoveableneſs in that precious confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his union with the Lord Jeſus, that was once raiſed in his heart by the power of that evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his union. And doubtleſs it is for that end, that believing Souls might thus exalt the name of God, in the unchangeableneſs of his love towards them, that the Lord hath prepared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Grounds, unmoveable Rocks for the feet of their Faith to ſtand upon, he hath added
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:48673:287"/>
his oath to his word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18. <hi>That by two immutable things by which it is impoſſible that God ſhould lye, they might have ſtrong conſolation that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Jeſus Chriſt tendered.</hi> It is for this end that he hath given thoſe unchangeable grounds for faith to build upon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That thoſe Ecclipſes of the glory of Gods love in Chriſt in its unchangeableneſs, by the conſtancy of the actings of Faith might be prevented. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was the bowels of the compaſſions of our ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God in Chriſt that wrought towards the unlove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Soul, that cauſed him to ſtoop down ſo low, as to add an oath to his word, which gives no ſecurity in it ſelf to a Soul more but only a fuller ſecurity to our unbelieving hearts, in our low apprehenſions of God, that thereby the precious conſolations of his People might not change; and it was the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end of God in the workings of thoſe compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that the glory of his own love might not be vailed by the unconſtancy and fickleneſs of the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of faith, ſo as Souls ſhould declare by believing, when their hearts are filled with holy actings, that there was a glorious love in God through Chriſt to unlovely ſinners, and when the apprehenſion of the livelineſs of thoſe holy actings in their hearts ſhould ceaſe, that then they ſhould again declare that the love of God in Chriſt is withdrawn again from them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the glory of his love in its unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, might ſhine forth in its brightneſs with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent glory, ſo as the Soul under the ſaddeſt defect of holy actings and workings in his own heart, might ſtill declare the precious love of God in Chriſt to his unlovely to be the ſame, ſounded upon his own
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:48673:288" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will only, which can never be moved. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and unmoveableneſs of the Soul in his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his union with Chriſt, (that the evidence of union with Chriſt begets) is always the effect of ſuch a beam of light from Heaven to reveal to a Soul his union, ſo long as the light continues ſhining into the Soul in its luſtre and glory. This you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of <hi>Paul,</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5, 6. <hi>Having received the earneſt of the ſpirit, what then? we are always confident of everlaſting communion with God:</hi> that is we are confident at all times, conſtantly our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is unmoveable. Yea doubtleſs ſeeing the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of light from the ſpirit of light ſhining into any Soul, is but an act of the conforming office of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, it cannot be but that light ſhining from the Spirit of light to evidence to the Soul its union, muſt neceſſarily eſtabliſh the heart in that confidence of his union with Jeſus Chriſt, that ſo long as that light remains the confidence muſt remain alſo, and that in its power and ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Thus you have the firſt way opened, how the name of God is exalted through a Soul, which is by the Souls bearing teſtimony to the truth of the record that the Lord hath given to his love in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt by the ſouls manifeſting the ſame glory of the love of God in Chriſt to ſinful ſouls, that God himſelf hath revealed to be in him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God is exalted through the Soul by the ſouls manifeſtation, that an incomprehenſible perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of purity and holineſs dwels in God, God hath revealed himſelf in his word not only to be holy, but holineſs it ſelf, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.2. <hi>The Lord hath ſworn by his holeneſs,</hi> that is, <hi>he hath ſworn by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> He hath diſcovered ſuch abſolute perfection
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:48673:288"/>
of holineſs to be in him, that he hath an abſolute unſpeakable abhorrency of all that is croſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto holineſs in its perfection, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. <hi>yea the brightneſs of the perfection of holineſs dwell in him, Exod.</hi> 15.11. Now then is the name of God exalted through a Soul, when the Soul conceives of God, as thus excellent and wonderful in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when the Soul declares before the world, that his God in Chriſt is purity and holineſs it ſelf. Hence it is that the holy Angels are ſaid to cry to the Lord, <hi>Holy, Holy is the Lord of Hoſts, Iſa.</hi> 6.3. and alſo the office of the diſpencers of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt is deſcribed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.8, 9. by their crying Night and Day without ceaſing, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty;</hi> it is for this reaſon, becauſe the name of God is exalted, when there are ſuch manifeſtations and declarations of an abſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of holineſs to dwell in God. Now a Soul may manifeſt this abſolute perfection of holineſs to dwell in God theſe three or four ſeveral ways.</p>
               <p n="1">I. By a precious ſenſible acknowledgement of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite diſproportion and diſagreement in his moſt holy, exact, exquiſite actions (when the Soul is moſt mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſiſted by the ſpirit of God) to the Lords bleſſed holy will. When a Soul freely declares his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all the actings of holineſs in his heart to be but unholineſs, compared with the exact, perfect, holy will of God, when it acknowledges with the Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.16. <hi>That its righteouſneſs is but as filthy rags, as a menſtruous Cloath,</hi> all pollution and defilement it ſelf, in compariſon of that moſt bleſſed, holy will of God, then doth the Soul exalt the Lord, by declaring an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute perfection of holineſs to dwell in him. And thence it is, that confeſſion of ſin is neceſſary for
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:48673:289" rendition="simple:additions"/>
believing Souls, though ſin be pardoned, and though there be large manifeſtations alſo of the pardon of ſin renewed, becauſe thoſe confeſſions of ſin and the large acknowledgements of the vile curſed workings of the corrupt heart, (and the vaſt diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Lords bleſſed, holy will, and his unholy will) the Soul exalts the name of God by bearing teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the perfection of holineſs that dwells in God.</p>
               <p n="2">II. By declaring the leaſt aberration or deviation from the Lords bleſſed will, to be juſt matter of infinite wrath to be executed upon the Soul, and juſt matter of endleſs perplexity, trouble and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation unto the Soul. When a Soul manifeſts the leaſt ſtragling wandring thought from God, the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſedneſs of the heart to comply with the Lords bleſſed will, to be juſt occaſion for the Lord to let his fiery indignation burn for ever againſt the Soul; then doth the Soul bear teſtimony to that unſpeakable perfection of holineſs that dwels in God: Then doth the Soul ſay virtually Thy will O Lord is ſo perfectly holy, that it is infinitely equal that thy will ſhould be obeyed in all things, in that thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeſt nothing but is ſo abſolutely and perfectly good; that he that neglects obedience to that thy bleſſed will in the leaſt, is worthy to have exact ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance executed upon him, for a croſs, crooked, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious-hearted wretch. Thus the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.22. <hi>acknowledges it is of the Lords mercy that we are not conſumed, becauſe his compaſſions fail not.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.3. <hi>O Lord if thou ſhouldſt mark iniquitie who ſhall ſtand;</hi> that is to ſay, Lord the leaſt iniquity if thou doſt execute the juſt deſert of it upon any Soul, none then ſhould ever ſtand before thee; every Soul ſhould periſh to eternity. Thus God
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:48673:289" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is exalted through the Soul; and mark it, this is the uſe of all thoſe ſelf-judgings that believing Souls are ſo frequent in the true holy uſe of, it is for this reaſon that you ſhall hear believing Souls both publick and private paſſing the ſentence of condemnation againſt themſelves, though they know the ſentence of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſhall not paſs againſt them, though their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is ſhared in the Court of their conſciences; yea when the pardon is moſt evidently ſealed to them, then you ſhall hear them moſt full of thoſe judgements paſt againſt themſelves, ſaying we are worthy O Lord to be confounded, it were but righteous in our God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in our ſelves, to make us an everlaſting ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence to his pureſt eyes. Thus by theſe ſelf judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they bear publick teſtimony to the moſt exact, exquiſite perfection of holineſs that dwels in God.</p>
               <p n="3">III. By manifeſting that the leaſt communion with God in Chriſt, doth neceſſarily ſanctifie any Soul in ſome degree; When a Soul declares practically, that it is impoſſible for any Soul to have communion with God in Chriſt, but he ſhall participate in ſome degree of the holineſs of God, the diſpoſition of his corrupt will ſhall be changed, then doth a Soul manifeſt a perfection of holineſs to dwell in God.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. By declaring that a perfection of conformity to the Lords bleſſed will, ought to be the only ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying object of the deſires of any ſoul. When a Soul manifeſts practically and apparently, that no Soul ought to take up any reſt in any degree of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs leſs then a perfect conformity to the Lords bleſſed will. Now this perfect conformity to the Lords will conſiſts in three or four particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When he declares that every Soul ought to will every thing that the Lord himſelf wills.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="564" facs="tcp:48673:290"/>2. When he declares that every object that the will of the Soul ought to cloſe with, ought to be cloſed with, only becauſe God wills it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. when the Soul wills only that which the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Majeſty of God wills.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When the Soul wills every thing in the ſame manner that God himſelf wills it. Now there are four things to be conſidered in the manner of the Lords willing any thing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whatever the Lord wills, he wills with infinite freedom. So that then the perfect conformity of the Souls will conſiſts in the freedom of the Souls compliance with the will of God, when he wills what God himſelf wills, and wills it freely accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as God wills it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whatever the Lord wills, he wills purely, he wills it becauſe he wills it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whatever the Lord wills, he wills with facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and eaſineſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the Lords willing that which is holy, his will moves neceſſarily, though yet with infinite freedom. It is with infinite freedom that the Lord wills holineſs; but yet there is ſuch a neceſſity from the eſſence and being of God, that his will wills holineſs only, and that he can will nothing elſe but what is holy. Thus when the Soul ſhall practically manifeſt, that the groanings and thirſtings, and pantings and breathings of every Soul ſhould never ceaſe till there be this bleſſed union of wills between God and them, that their wills ſhould even move as it were in a circle of holineſs, as the bleſſed will of God moves; then doth a Soul declare that an infinite perfection of holineſs dwells in God, and then is God exalted through the Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="565" facs="tcp:48673:290"/>Now it remains to be opened, that the name of God is exalted through every believing Soul, in this tranſcendent glory of his holineſs, to whom the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth reveal certainly his union with the Lord Jeſus: This muſt appear by the manifeſting that the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt in revealing to any Soul his union with Chriſt, doth certainly cauſe the Soul to walk in thoſe ways, through which the name of God is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in the brightneſs and perfection of the glory of his holineſs through the Soul</p>
               <p n="1">I. The Spirit of Chriſt in evidencing to the Soul his union with Chriſt, doth neceſſarily draw forth thoſe ſenſible free acknowledgements from the Soul, of an infinite diſproportion and diſagreement in the moſt exact, exquiſite action that ever the Soul per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the Lords infinite, holy will. This you may obſerve in, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. comparing <hi>ver.</hi> 4. and <hi>ver.</hi> 6. ſaith the Church, <hi>From the beginning of the world men have not heard nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye ſeen, O God, beſides thee what he hath prepared for them that wait for him,</hi> that is for the believing Soul, (for waiting is but an extended act of faith) And then under thoſe apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the unſpeakeableneſs of the Lords Love in Chriſt to every believing Soul, ſhe breaks out, but we are <hi>all as an unclean thing, and all our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> (all our duties and performances, our moſt holy actings) <hi>they are but as filthy raggs.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is obſervable in the holy man <hi>Job,</hi> who ſtood much upon his own uprightneſs and integrity, Chap. 23.11, 12. and Chap. 27.5, 6. <hi>Till I die I will not remove my integrity from me;</hi> that is, I will not deny my innocency and righteouſneſs; I have wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked before God with a perfect heart, I will never
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:48673:291"/>
reproach my ſelf till I die, ſo Chap. 31.6. <hi>Let me be weighed in an even Ballance that God may know my integrity;</hi> yet in Chap. 4.3, 4. this <hi>Job</hi> that could declare ſo many righteous acts of his own, begins freely to acknowledge, that all his righteouſneſs was as vileneſs; though thoſe actions of righteouſneſs had been performed by him with much integrity, yet there was an infinite diſproportion between the holy actings of the Lords bleſſed will: then ſaith <hi>Job, behold I am vile, what ſhall I anſwer thee? I have laid my hand upon my mouth; once have I ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but I will not anſwer; yea twice, but I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further:</hi> I will not call to God to weigh me in a Ballance any more that he may know my inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity; ſo Chap. 42.5, 6. <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye ſeeth thee; wherefore I abhor my ſelf and repent in duſt and aſhes;</hi> repent, that is, the thoughts of my ſelf now change, I am ſo aſhamed I loath and abhor my ſelf in the ſight of all my integrity and righteouſneſs that I ſo much ſtood upon. And certainly there is an infallible neceſſity of a Souls exalting the name of God through thoſe ſenſible free acknowledgements of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite diſproportion between the holy actings of his will, and the holy actings of the Lords will, whenever the ſpirit of Chriſt do reveal to any Soul his union.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard the faculty of the Souls ſpiritual ſight was then lively, active and ready for exerciſe. The eye of the Soul is as it were open, and in every du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that he performs to God, he can behold the leaſt inward ſluggiſhneſs and indiſpoſedneſs, ſo as the leaſt of thoſe infirmities is burdenſom; and mark, that is the reaſon that believing Souls once decaying in the life of holineſs, loſe the ſenſe of the evidence to their Souls of their union with Chriſt, becauſe every day
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:48673:291"/>
their own formality, hardneſs, blockiſhneſs, inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſs, is leſs burdenſom to them, becauſe the faculty of ſpiritual ſight is out of exerciſe. And that's the reaſon alſo that under the cleareſt ſight of the Souls union with Chriſt, there is the largeſt confeſſion of the Souls own vileneſs, the ſpiritual faculty of ſight in the believing Soul, is then drawn up in its ſtrength: thats one of the great reaſons why thoſe Souls that enjoy the cleareſt revelations of the Lords love in Chriſt are the moſt abaſed Souls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the ſpirit reveals to the Soul its union with Chriſt, then the precious heavenly light that diſcovers all the unſutableneſs of the Souls will to Gods will, ſhines clearly and actually. The tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparent light of the Lords love in Chriſt to ſo unlove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Soul, is like a bleſſed, heavenly Lamp lighted up within the Believers heart, through the light of which the Soul may ſee every unſutableneſs in his will to the Lords bleſſed will; and that in its vileneſs, in its moſt odious native colours: yea, that light of the Lords Love in Chriſt to the loveleſs Soul, cauſes the infinite right that the Lord hath to claim all the powers and poſſibilities of the Soul to be ſubject to him, to ſhine clearly in the Soul; it makes the heart ſay within it ſelf, O how infinitely due is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very acting of my Soul to God, to be employed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his bleſſed pleaſure: ſo that now there is light without to enable the Soul to ſee the unſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs of its will to Gods will; as well as there is light within, that the Soul ſeeth not only like a man having a perfect ſight, but as a man with a perfect ſight in a clear Sun-ſhine day, that ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern every more in the Sun Beams, that a man with a clear ſight in a dark day cannot behold: and thence
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:48673:292"/>
it is, that the evidence unto the Soul of its union with Chriſt cannot but draw ſorth an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the infinite diſproportion of the Souls actings to the Lords holy will, in regard the Soul is then enabled to diſcern the ſmalleſt unſutableneſs that is in his will to the Lords will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard that light that ſhines into the Soul at that time, diſcovers thoſe unholineſſes in the holy actings of the Soul, whereof a believing Soul is moſt peculiarly guilty in all his holy actings. There are four wants of holineſs in all the actings of believing Souls in ſome meaſure and degree.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The want of pure Love in all the holy act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Soul. The want of the Souls aiming meerly at the exaltation and glory of his deareſt Father in the Lord Jeſus, and ſo acting in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Fathers bleſſed will, from a pure Child-like diſpoſition working in the heart, that diſpoſes him to comply with the Fathers will only, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Fathers will. This is pure Love, when the Soul out of Love to God himſelf, without relation to any benefit or advantage that the Soul enjoys with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out relation to any fear of any loſs or dammage that the Soul ſhould ſuffer through diſobedience, to aim at and intend only the fulfilling of his bleſſed Fathers will; now this in every holy duty the Soul performs, is in ſome degree of its perfection wanting.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is the want of freedom of Spirit or liberty, in their holy actings in their wills, agreeing with the Lords bleſſed will. When the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt breaths upon the holy diſpoſition and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, infuſed into Believers wills moſt ſweetly and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully, and aſſiſt them ſtrongly in their exerciſe, yet then while they dwell in theſe <hi>Bodies</hi> of <hi>Clay,</hi> (while the
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:48673:292" rendition="simple:additions"/>
old man remains not wholly crucified) there wants ſome perfection of Liberty in their Spirits in theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly actings the ſoul is not wholly void of ſome inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diſpoſition acting ſecretly, that bends the ſoul from thoſe holy actings that yet the <hi>Soul</hi> is exerciſed in.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the holy actings of believing Souls, there is a want of fulneſs of complacency, delight and contentment in thoſe holy actings. The fleſh mutters and murmurs againſt the actings of the Spirit; this made <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>with my mind I ſerve the Law of God, and with my fleſh the Law of Sin, and I delight in the Law of God according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man:</hi> ſtill there is an oppoſite party that is not ſatisfyed in thoſe holy actings; <hi>the Spirit is willing,</hi> ſaith Chriſt concerning his Apoſtles, <hi>but the fleſh is weak;</hi> the fleſh will never anſwer the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits readineſs perfectly, ſo as all the whole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and poſſibilities of Soul and Body ſhould run parallel with one another in their holy actings, till this mortal ſhall have put on immortality.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There is a want of an abſolute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingneſs in the Soul, in the precious, holy actings of the Soul. That vile principle of Self-confidence is ſo firmly rooted in our natures, that when the ſanctifying Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt hath had a bleſſed work upon the unholy heart; yet then the bitter root of Self-confidence will be ſending forth ſome curſed ſprigs, be will ſprouting forth in ſome unholy actings, even in the midſt of the Souls actings, the Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never perfectly and abſolutely nothing in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his holy actings. Thence you may obſerve from your experience, an infinite difficulty that you find after great enlargements of heart in a holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then to think no better of your ſelves for the
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:48673:293" rendition="simple:additions"/>
duty; It muſt be a mighty power of the ſpirit that muſt draw forth from a Soul at ſuch a time that voice in ſincerity, ſaying, not I, but the grace of God that was in me. Now that Light that diſcovers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a believing Soul thoſe unholineſſes of his, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the believing Soul is conſtantly guilty in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in all his holy actings) is an unſeparable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant upon the Spirit of Light, evidencing to the Soul its union with the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>There is only the light of the Lords Love in Chriſt to the worthleſs nothing-like Soul, that diſcovers the want of pure Love in the Souls actings of holineſs. It is the viſion of the Lords Love unto. the Soul, that excites and ſtirs up actings of Love in the Soul unto God: So likewiſe the viſion of the Lords Love in Chriſt unto the Soul, enables the Soul to diſcern the want of pure, perfect Love in his Soul unto God. It is then when a Soul ſees that Love of God in Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his unlovely unſpeakable ſoul, that he apprehends deeply, that the moſt ſuperlative actings of his Love are due from him unto God again; and then doth the Soul diſcern the great evil of the imperfection of the actings of his own Love, ſo as to anſwer the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Lords will out of pure Love only. Thence it is, when the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt doth evidence unto it his union with Chriſt; then any ſlaviſh work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of fear are tedious and burdenſom unto the Soul; whereas before the Soul thought thoſe actings of fear (if they brought ſorth but ſome Tears) to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious actings, but now it loaths them. So likewiſe it is only the Light of the Lords Love in Jeſus Chriſt to the worthleſs ſoul, that diſcovers clearly the want of freedom and liberty in the heart in its holy actings. Then indeed the ſoul groans not only for
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:48673:293"/>
the want of his heart anſwering the Lords will in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, (and ſo for want of holy actings) but he groans under the want of freedom of ſpirit in thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly actings alſo. So likewiſe the want of perfect reſt and complacency of the Soul in his holy actings, is made manifeſt, only through the light of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Love of the Lord in Jeſus Chriſt to the loveleſs Soul. No Soul can diſcern matter wherein he may take up a fulneſs of reſt only in obedience to the Lords will, till he diſcerns God as he is in Jeſus Chriſt to his unlovely Soul; and therefore the want of the Souls fulneſs of contentment in the actings of holineſs, can never be made clearly manifeſt, till the light of the Lords love in Jeſus Chriſt ſhines upon it; yea the lively beauty, excellency and glory that is in the bare fulfilling of the Lords holy will, only ſhines clearly to the Soul through the light of the Lords love in Jeſus Chriſt. Yea the want of an abſolute nothingneſs in himſelf in his holy actings, is made apparent to the Soul through the light of the Lords Love in Jeſus Chriſt ſhining upon him. Never can a Soul apprehend that all that he is, and all that the powers and poſſibilities of his Soul can perform, and infinitely more, is due from his Soul unto God, till the glorious light of the Lords love in Chriſt ſhine upon him: It is only when the light of that love ſhines, that the heart ſays in ſincerity to it ſelf, what thinkeſt thou, O my heart, is due to thee, though now thou haſt been enlarged by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit of Chriſt in this holy duty? Art not an unprofitable Servant, not having given to the Lord the hundred thouſandth part what thou doſt owe to him.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. When the Spirit evidenceth unto any Soul his union with the Lord Jeſus, ſenſible, free acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:48673:294"/>
of an infinite diſproportion in the moſt holy actings of the Soul to the Lords holy, bleſſed will, are neceſſarily drawn forth, in regard the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holineſs that conſtantly attends in ſome degree the actings of holineſs in Souls, are at the ſame time moſt croſs and oppoſite to the Souls deſires. The deſires of the ſoul being but the reachings forth of love, and the higheſt actings of love being the neceſſary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of thoſe higheſt diſcoveries of the Lords love to the ſoul: thence neceſſarily the higheſt deſires of the ſoul are raiſed to a ſuperlative height after fulneſs of unity, and perfect communion with God in Chriſt, when the ſpirit evidenceth to the ſoul his union with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">V. When the ſpirit evidenceth to the ſoul its uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt, the ſpiritual ſenſe of the ſoul is then moſt lively. The ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly a quickening ſpirit, where he is a comforting ſpirit, the ſoul being filled with comfort, cannot but be filled with life; and when the ſoul is filled with life, ſenſe is alſo lively; ſo that thence the ſoul at that time is moſt ſenſible of his own unholineſs, and thence neceſſarily is conſtrained to acknowledge ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly the diſagreement of his will in his moſt holy act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to the Lords moſt holy bleſſed will.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſpirit evidencing to any ſoul its union with the Lord Jeſus, doth certainly draw forth free de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations from the ſoul, that the leaſt tranſgreſſion of the Lords bleſſed will is juſt occaſion of incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the wrath of God infinitely and eternally againſt the ſoul, and juſt occaſion of unſpeakable perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and grief to the ſoul. So that through this a ſoul declares that bleſſed will of God to be ſo abſolutely, ſo perfectly holy, that the leaſt oppoſing of that bleſſed
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:48673:294"/>
will, might juſtly deprive him of acceptance. Thus you may obſerve when the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up the heart of the Church to precious believing Acts, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.22 23, 24. then did the ſame ſpirit draw from their mouths ſenſible declarations, that the leaſt of their tranſgreſſions did juſtly expoſe them to the everlaſting burning, to be conſumed in the fire of the Lords Indignation; then ſhe cries out <hi>It is of the Lords mercies that we are not conſumed becauſe his compaſſions fails not.</hi> So likewiſe, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.3. when the heart of the Pſalmiſt was up in believing actings, then ſaith he, <hi>If thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt mark, iniquity who ſhall ſtand?</hi> The leaſt ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity that remains in the moſt ſanctified ſouls, were enough to caſt them down into the everlaſting Lake of burning, if the Lord ſhould act in juſtice with them. Hence it is, that when Jeſus Chriſt draws forth the ſweeteſt believing actings in the hearts of Believers, then they are moſt ready to accept of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny chaſtiſement that the Lord inflicts upon them, in reſpect of their tranſgreſſions, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.39. So that thence ſouls enjoying the cleareſt beams of light from the ſpirit of light, revealing unto them their union with the Lord Jeſus, are commonly moſt filled with acclamations againſt themſelves, and all their prayers filled with ſelf-judgings and abhorrings. Yea likewiſe hence it is alſo, that believing ſouls enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the evidences of their union with Jeſus Chriſt, are filled with thoſe high admirations, and that their ſouls conceive of the love of God in Jeſus Chriſt to them as a myſtery unſearchable, paſt finding out ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Men or Angels, becauſe then they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the infinite worthineſs of thoſe thouſands and ten thouſands, and Millions of iniquity that they have committed, to incenſe the anger of the Lord againſt
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:48673:295" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their Souls. Yea likewiſe hence alſo proceed thoſe enlarged deſires after the ſweeteſt meltings of heart for ſin, from thoſe Souls to whom the ſpirit of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath certainly evidenced their union with him. But as the Scripture teſtifies to the truth of this; ſo reaſon teſtifies that there cannot but be a connexion between the ſpirits evidencing to the ſoul its union with Jeſus Chriſt, and the ſouls ſenſe of worthineſs for the leaſt tranſgreſſion, to be puniſhed with everlaſting indignation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard the ſpirits evidencing unto the ſoul that it is united to Jeſus Chriſt, doth declare and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to the ſoul the equity of a perfect ſubjection of every ſoul, to the Lords bleſſed holy will. When the ſpirit bears witneſs to the ſoul, that the bleſſed Majeſty of Heaven is willing to be reconciled and united to poor deſpicable, rebellious wretches, to thoſe whoſe hearts ſwell with enmity againſt the Crown of his glory, yea when the ſpirit teſtifies that the Lord even ſeeks and ſues for the reconciliation with the ſoul, thence it cannot but be clearly manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to the Soul that is but infinitely equal that a poor rebellious wretch, yea ſuch a deſperate enemy to his bleſſed Majeſty, ſhould conſent to what the Lord propounds: Now from this manifeſtation of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite equity of a perfect ſubjection to be given by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoul to the Lords bleſſed will, from thence there is neceſſarily ſuch deep apprehenſions of the infinite injuſtice and unſearchable depth of unrighteouſneſs and wickedneſs that is in the leaſt contradicting that bleſſed will, that the Soul conceives every ſuch tranſgreſſion or diſobedience to that bleſſed will, to be infinitely worthy to be puniſhed with infinite and everlaſting indignation.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="575" facs="tcp:48673:295"/>2. The Spirits evidencing unto the Soul, that it is united unto Jeſus Chriſt, doth declare the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute perfection of goodneſs in the Lords bleſſed will, ſo as it manifeſts every motion of that will to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely tranſcendently good. When the ſpirit bears witneſs unto any ſoul of its union with Jeſus Chriſt, it repreſents God only as a maſs of love in Jeſus Chriſt; It repreſents God willing all kinds and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of good unto every Soul that will accept it; and thence every act of the Lords bleſſed will is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Soul as abſolutely good: now by that means every tranſgreſſion of the Lords will is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as in oppoſition to infinite goodneſs, and thence every tranſgreſſion cannot but be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a juſt occaſion for infinite wrath and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to burn in its fierceneſs and extremity againſt the Soul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Spirits evidencing unto a Soul his union with Chriſt, doth neceſſarily occaſion the ſoul to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to the honour of God, that the leaſt degree of communion with God, cauſes any Soul to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate in ſome degree of his holineſs. This the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle teſtifies, in 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>That while they did with open-face behold as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, they were changed into the ſame in age from glory to glory;</hi> that is, they are conformed into the likeneſs of God while they ſee the beams of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency glitter upon them, through the great truths of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt; yea, that gradually according as they behold the glory, ſo they are changed alſo by degrees from glory unto glory, from one degree of likeneſs unto God to another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. Thus likewiſe the Apoſtle teſtifies, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>That God is light,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>that he
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:48673:296" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is holineſs itſelf, purely holy, nothing but holy,</hi> and then bears witneſs that it is impoſſible for any ſoul to have the leaſt fellowſhip with him, but we muſt be partakers of that holineſs; <hi>if we ſay that we have fellowſhip with him and walk in darkneſs, we lye and do not the truth:</hi> as if the Apoſtle had ſpoken in theſe words; The Lord is ſo infinitely tranſcendently holy, ſuch an infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of holineſs dwells in him, and an infinite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs to any thing that is unholy, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible any ſoul ſhould dwell with him but he muſt participate of his holineſs. So in 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.6. <hi>He that ſaith he abideth in him, ought himſelf alſo to walk e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as he walked.</hi> So likewiſe he teſtifies the ſame thing again, in 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Whoſoever abideth in him</hi> (that is united to Jeſus Chriſt, hath union and communion with him) <hi>ſinneth not;</hi> that is, he ſins not according to the manner that he ſinned before his union with Jeſus Chriſt; there are other diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion infuſed into his heart, there are ſome drops of the holineſs of Jeſus Chriſt communicated to his Soul through his union with Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>whoſoever ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth hath, not ſeen him neither knows him;</hi> that is, whoever ſins in the ſame manner that he did when he was void of the knowledge of Chriſt, void of union and communion with him, whatever he profeſſeth, he had not the experimental knowledge of the love of God that joyned his heart to Chriſt: he never had the true viſion of the glory of Jeſus Chriſt, he hath not ſo ſeen him whereby his Soul was transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the likeneſs of Chriſt. And in regard of this, that the ſpirits evidencing unto the Soul that he is united unto Jeſus Chriſt, doth neceſſarily cauſe ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, that the leaſt degree of communion with
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:48673:296"/>
God cauſe the Soul to participate of the holineſs of God. Thence it is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the ſin and tranſgreſſion of a Soul en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the evidence of his union with Chriſt, is ſo intollerably burdenſom. This is the reaſon why ſouls enjoying the evidence of their union with Chriſt, melt and break ſo ſweetly under the remembrance of any ſin, that they are confounded in themſelves, that they loath and abhor themſelves in regard the glory of God is ſo ecclipſed; and thence the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his own ſin wounds ſo deeply, becauſe in effect he by ſenſual, formal, unworthy walking doth declare that communion with God, doth not make him partaker of his holineſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This is the reaſon why the ſins of thoſe that are united to Jeſus Chriſt, do ſtir up the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of God in a ſuperlative manner; (though his diſpleaſure works but in a fatherly manner againſt their Perſons) becauſe by their ſins the glory of his holineſs is ecclipſed; they profeſs God not to be ſo abſolutely holy but a Soul may have fellowſhip with God, and yet be unholy, and this caſts a black cloud upon the Lords perfect holineſs. Hence it is that the Lord complained ſo bitterly againſt <hi>the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Nation of the Jews, when they walked unholy and unſutably, becauſe they cauſed his name to be polluted among the Heathen, Ezek.</hi> 36.21, 22, 23. <hi>Thence the diſpleaſure of God was incenſed ſo high againſt the holy man David becauſe of his unworthy walking,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Thou haſt cauſed the enemies of God to blaſpheme,</hi> that is, to ſpeak againſt God, to have unworthy thoughts of God; and thence it is that the Lord teſtifies an higher degree of abhorrence of his Peoples ſins, than he doth of the ſins of thoſe that
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:48673:297" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are not joyned to him, and remitted into union with him in Chriſt: thence the Lord commands the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to profeſs more diſpleaſure againſt the ſins of them that profeſs themſelves to be one with God, then againſt the ſins of any other, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9, 10 11. <hi>If any man that is called a Brother be a Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or covetous, or an Idolater, or a Railer, or a Drunkard, or an Extortioner,</hi> with ſuch a one no not to eat; It is not meant eating at the Lords Table, but to ſit down in a civil way of eating at the Table with him; he vails Gods glory and profeſſeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> God is not ſo abſolutely pure but he can behold iniquity, or not ſo abſolutely holy but there may be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him, and yet be unholy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This is the reaſon, that Souls enjoying the evidence of their union with Chriſt, declares ſuch ardent deſires after, and ſuch a conſtant neceſſity of attending upon the Lords appointments for commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, becauſe hereby they declare, that converſe and communion with God doth neceſſarily make a Soul partaker of his holineſs. And it is from hence that Souls are always longing and breathing after communion with God through his ordinances that they might be partakers of his holineſs: ſo it is through the manifeſtation of thoſe breathings after communion with him, that their Souls declare pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically, that ſtill further every degree of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, doth make the Soul further partaker of his holineſs; ſeeing they declare it is for that end they attend upon the Lord in ordinances, and long after ordinances that they might go on to perfect ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This is the reaſon that the ſpirit of God doth ſo vehemently preſs and urge believing Souls
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:48673:297" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to manifeſt holineſs, to walk worthy of God, and worthy of their high calling that is in Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hereby they declare that communion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God doth neceſſarily make a Soul parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the holineſs of God. And thence it is, <hi>that walking holily, is call'd a walking, holy of their high calling, Eph.</hi> 4.1. <hi>And it is called a walking wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God, Col.</hi> 1.10. Thus the Scripture evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denceth, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſpirits revealing his union with Chriſt, doth neceſſarily occaſion the Soul to declare that the leaſt degree of communion and converſe with God, doth make a Soul partaker of the holineſs of God. And likewiſe even reaſon it ſelf teſtifies it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard the ſpirits evidencing unto the Soul its union with Jeſus Chriſt, gives the Soul ſuch large and ſweet experience, that communion with God doth make the Soul participate of the holineſs of God; that thence the Soul cannot but declare what he ſees and knows by his own experience. When once the ſpirit of light reveals to the Soul his union with Chriſt, both to faith and ſenſe, a Soul is made to diſcern ſo clearly, ſuch precious diſpoſitions of holineſs, to be infuſed from the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt into his heart; that thence he hath ſuch undeniable experience that the leaſt viſion of the glory of God in Chriſt, the leaſt communion of wills between God and the Soul in Chriſt, doth make the Soul ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the holineſs of God, that the Soul cannot but manifeſt it upon all occaſions practically, he cannot but declare it proverbally upon every call he hath to give ſuch a teſtimony according to that in <hi>Acts</hi> 4.20. <hi>We cannot but ſpeak the things we have ſeen and heard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſpirits evidencing unto a Soul his union with
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:48673:298" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Chriſt, gives the Soul ſuch affecting experiences of the ſanctifying vertue of communion with God, that the heart is even fired with affection, and thence it cannot but declare the glorious ſanctifying-vertue in communion with God in Chriſt. The ſoul recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving light from the ſpirit of light to declare to his union with Chriſt; doth not only enjoy the experience of the vertue of communion, but at that time, that experience ſo takes and raviſhes the heart, ſtirs up ſuch rapture of love and delight in thoſe acts of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, that thence fire may as ſoon keep in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and the Cloaths not ſmell (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks) a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the experience that the ſoul enjoys be kept cloſe unrevealed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſpirits evidencing unto any ſoul his union with Chriſt, begets ſuch ardent, ſuch ſuperlative actings of love towards the honour of God, and ſuch an high degree of abhorrence of all diſhonour unto God, that thence the manifeſtation of the abſolute perfection of holineſs that dwells in God, (by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that the leaſt communion with him makes a ſoul holy) doth neceſſarily grow in that ſoul. It is the great <hi>Maxim</hi> of the Covenant, that the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords love to the ſoul, begets love in the ſoul to God again: ſo that then the glorious teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Lords Love in Chriſt, in admiſſion of the ſoul into union with Chriſt, cannot but raiſe the higheſt actings of love to God in the ſoul, and thoſe actings of love towards God, do and will take the honour and glory of God for their object as well as any other attribute that can be conceived in God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſpirits evidence unto any ſoul of his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt doth, cauſe all the engagements that are laid by God upon a believing ſoul, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:48673:298"/>
the name of God in his holineſs, to return upon the Soul with power and irreſiſtible ſtrength. There is indeed conſtantly ſome degree of ſenſe in every believing ſoul of infinite engagements laid by God upon him, to oblige and engage him to exalt God in his holineſs, but thoſe engagements are weaker or ſtronger, according to the clearneſs or darkneſs of the ſpirits evidence to the Soul of its union with Chriſt: And thoſe engagements that the Soul apprehends to be laid upon him to exalt God in his holineſs, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo actually brought to the ſouls remembrance and preſt upon the Soul, according to the frequency of the ſpirits giving actual evidence unto the Soul of his union with Chriſt. So that then only when the Spirit doth actually evidence unto the Soul with moſt clearneſs and perſpecuity its union with Chriſt, then do all the engagements that believing Souls ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that God have ſaid upon them, to bind them to exalt God in his holineſs, come upon them with power and force ſo as a conſtraint comes upon the ſpirit, the Soul being drawn as it were by cords, to ſtudy and exalt the name of God in his holineſs.</p>
               <p>As for inſtance,</p>
               <p>Firſt, when the ſpirit evidenceth to the Soul his union with Chriſt, the Soul is actually at that time ſenſible that he was choſen from eternity to be a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of honour, into whom the holineſs of God ſhould be poured, that the glory of the Lords holineſs might appear. So that then the Soul ſtands ſtrongly bent, through the ſtrength of this engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment God hath laid upon him to lift up the name of God in his holineſs, and to make the holineſs of the name of God appear.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When the ſpirit evidenceth to the Soul
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:48673:299"/>
his union with Chriſt; the Soul is actually ſenſibl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that the Lord hath created him anew, <hi>for that ver end that he might glorifie the Lord in his holineſs.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. <hi>We are all his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip created unto good works;</hi> that is, created un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to holineſs, to fruits of holineſs, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the manifeſtation of the glory of the Lords holineſs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When the ſpirit manifeſts unto the ſoul his union with Chriſt; it is actually ſenſible that the very end of God in the communication of any of his holineſs unto him is the manifeſtation of the glory of his holineſs through the Soul. Thus then in regard the ſpirits evidence of a ſouls union with Chriſt doth occaſion a being actually ſenſible of deep engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments laid upon him by God to be exalting him in his holineſs: thence the ſpirits evidence doth neceſſarily occaſion the Soul to declare, that the leaſt degree of communion with God doth make it to participate in ſome degree of the Lords holineſs. So that it is evident both from Scripture and Reaſon, that this third Teſtimony concerning the abſolute perfection of the Lords holineſs, whereby he is exalted through any Soul is the neceſſary, certain, infallible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the ſpirits evidencing to any ſoul his union with the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth way whereby God is exalted through the Soul, by bearing witneſs to the perfection of his holineſs, is this, when a Soul doth declare that a perfection of conformity to the Lords bleſſed will in every thing, ought to be the only ſatisfying ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the deſires of any Soul. Now even this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God magnyfying act of a believing Soul, is alſo the neceſſary effect of the ſpirits evidencing to
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:48673:299"/>
any ſoul its union with Chriſt. Thus you ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt produced this bleſſed effect in <hi>Paul</hi>'s heart, to whom the ſpirit did vouchſafe the cleareſt revelation, and moſt Soul-ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing Teſtimony of his union with Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12, 13, 14. <hi>Brethren I count not my ſelf to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting thoſe things that are before, I preſs towards the mark of the price of the high calling of God in Christ Jeſus.</hi> Here are four or five things the Apoſtle teſtifies to be the practice of his own Soul, for the exalting of the Lord in his holineſs, and ſo conſequently teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies it to be the effect of the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt in any believing Soul, to whom he reveals his union with Chriſt</p>
               <p>Firſt, He teſtifies his eſtimation of himſelf, that he doth account himſelf as yet to be altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, unholy; I count not my ſelf to have appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended: he teſtifies that the power and vertue of the death and reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt was not yet fully made manifeſt in his Soul; that is, the ſin mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying vertue of the death of Jeſus Chriſt; the quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening and enlivening vertue of the reſurrection of Chriſt is not yet fully attained to in his Soul.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He teſtifies that the only end upon which the eye of his Soul was fixed, was' a perfect conformity unto Chriſt. The fulneſs of an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental knowledge of the death and reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, as he tells you, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>he follows after that he may apprehend that for which alſo he was apprehended of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and alſo he tells us, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>he preſſed forward towards the mark</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 10 <hi>that the only end of his was to know Chriſt,</hi> that is, to know him experimentally, in the vertue of his death,
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:48673:300"/>
and the power of his reſurrection, having the ſenſe of the glory, vertue and power of his death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection in his own ſpirit: ſo that herein he teſtifies that his Soul ſtands reſolved to be ſatiſfyed with no degree of holineſs, and therein by conſequence te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies that nothing but the fulneſs of likeneſs to Jeſus Chriſt ſhall ever ſatisfie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly he teſtifies that all his labours and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours after this experience of all the vertue of the death and reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, are acoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him as nothing, <hi>I forget ſaith he thoſe things that are behind, ver.</hi> 13. not that his Soul was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of thoſe precious experiences that the Lord hath given him of the death of Chriſt in killing his ſin and the power of Chriſt in enlivening his Soul, but he minded not all the degree of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of the death and reſurrection of Chriſt that his Soul was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of; ſo as to pleaſe himſelf with thoughts that he had attained to what he was commanded, he mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them not ſo as to ſatisfie himſelf with that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; though queſtionleſs the meaſure was very large, ſeeing he teſtifies often, <hi>that he was more than a Conqueror over all the powers of ſin, and that he was able to do all things through Chriſt ſtrengthening of him, and that he was ready to abound and ready to want,</hi> his heart being diſpoſed in a holy temper in all condition, ready to ſanctifie God in all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences; yet ſaith he <hi>I forget all thoſe,</hi> that is, I do not ſo remember them as to ſatisfie my ſelf that I had attained ſo much. The whole form of the expreſſion is but an alluſion to Runners in a Race, that never look how many paces of ground they have paſſed, over, ſo as to hinder them from running to the mark, but they keep their eye ſingly fixed upon

the mark that they are to attain to, ſo ſaith he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the things that are behind.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He teſtifies, that the ſtrenght of all his affections, the whole intention of his ſoul is bent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the attaining the fulneſs of the experience, of the vertue and power of the death and reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, this he teſtifies <hi>ver.</hi> 13. reaching ſorth unto thoſe things that are before; (breathing forth) ſtill in a metaphorical way he alludes to <hi>Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Race, that run without ſtretched arms, reaching forth towards the mark,</hi> the word in the Original is <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Fifthly, He teſtifies that he paſſeth over, or leaps over all difficulties, all impediments and hindrances, in his ſtriving after this perfect conformity to Jeſus Chriſt in his Death and Reſurrection, which is alſo contained in that he doth profeſs towards the mark, he doth thruſt through all troops of impediments that ſtand to oppoſe him in his way, and with all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and poſſibilities of his ſoul extended, makes the perſuit after the full experience of the vertue of the Death and Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.

have apprehended, and let us fix our eyes ſingly, and conſtantly upon the perfect holineſs that ſouls attain to, through Communion with Chriſt in his Death and Reſurrection, and let us forget all our labours and endeavours, and all the degrees of holineſs that we have attainted to, ſo as not to ſatisfy our ſelves in that meaſure and degree, and let us ſtretch out our Arms after full Communion with Jeſus Chriſt, and let us paſs over all difficulties preſſing towards the mark, the fulneſs of Conformity to the Lords will, which the Lord hath determined to bring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leivers to through Communion with Jeſus Chriſt their Mediatour, in his Death and Reſurrection. Likewiſe the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> teſtifies as much in 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>Every one that hath this hope in him purifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf even as he is pure:</hi> Mark what hope he ſpeaks of; The ſecond verſe tells you, ſaith he <hi>we are the Sons of God, and we know that when Chriſt appears we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is;</hi> So that the hope that he ſpeaks of is the hope of Adoption, the hope of their union with Chriſt the firſt-born of all the Elect ones and the hope of their perfect Union and Communion with Jeſus Chriſt in the higheſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens: Now mark what the effect of this hope is; Thoſe that have received this hope infuſed from the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt, it occaſions the ſouls to purify themſelves as Jeſus Chriſt is pure, that is all one as God the Father is pure, (Chriſt being but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs image of his Father) The Apoſtle means not that actually any ſoul having ſuch an evidence of his union with Chriſt from the ſpirit, as produceth that bleſſed hope in him, is actually purified according to purification of purity that is in Chriſt; But he means, that the ſoul into whom this hope of his union with
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:48673:304"/>
Chriſt is infuſed, doth deſire, breath after, long for endeavour with all the intentions of his ſoul, the ſame purity that is in Jeſus Chriſt, ſatisfying his ſoul with no degree, no meaſure, leſs then the fulneſs of likeneſs unto Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. Likewiſe it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that the ſpirit revealing unto any ſoul his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt, doth occaſion the ſoul to declare, that a conformity to the will of God is the only ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying object of the deſires of any ſoul, in regard the ſpirit of Chriſt makes the promiſes of union and Communion with God in Chriſt to be the motive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to perfection of holineſs. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. Now if the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry propounding of the promiſe be that which excites an heart unto perfect holineſs, (perfect Conformity to the Lords will) then much more muſt the ſenſe of the ſouls intereſt of Union and Communion with God in Chriſt, neceſſarily conſtrain a ſoul to purſue with all his ſtrength after perfection of conformity to the Lords will, and to declare that no leſs then Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Lords will perfectly ought to ſatisfie the deſires of any ſoul. And likewiſe it might be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the very prayer of the Apoſtle that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made for believing ſouls, which was for their perfect Conformity to the Lords will, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Now the very God of Peaee ſanctify you wholly in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Soul and Body:</hi> And he prays that they might be filled with the fulneſs of God <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.19. And as Scripture thus Teſtifies, that God is thus exalted in his holineſs in any ſoul to whom the ſpirit doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal its union with Jeſus Chriſt, by that ſouls decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that a Conformity to the Lords will perfectly, ought only to ſatisfy the deſires of any ſoul; So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the experience of ſouls receiving the evidence from the ſpirit of their union with Chriſt bears Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſame.</p>

Hence it is that thoſe ſouls that injoy the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of ther union with Chriſt, are unſatisfyed with their moſt holy duties, and acts of pureſt Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Lords bleſſed will. So that ſouls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying their union with Chriſt are always complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Imperfections and wants in their moſt holy actings. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hence it is that we ſhall hear conſtantly thoſe pretious ſouls complain with much Bitterneſs, of the narrowneſs and ſtraitneſs of the working of their wills in Conformity to the Lords Will.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You ſhall hear them always complaining (when Aſſiſted moſt mightily by the ſpirit of Chriſt) of their want of ſingleneſs of Simplicity of heart in their wills conforming to the Lords will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are conſtantly complaining of the want of liberty of ſpirit in the compliance of their wills with the Lords bleſſed will. This <hi>David</hi> Intimates when cries out 51.12. <hi>Reſtore to me the Joy of thy Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Eſtabliſh me with thy free Spirit:</hi> He Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended his ſpirit to be much under Bondage and Thraldom, and with much earneſtneſs he deſires Communion with God again.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hence thoſe ſouls are always ſadly complaining in their acts of pureſt obedience, of their want of fixedneſs and ſtability of the workings of the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of their wills to comply with Gods will.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You ſhall hear them complain of the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Imperfection of the inward acts of the moſt pure Obedience that their ſouls render, of the Imperfection of their deſires in prayer, even when they are drawn out by a mighty power from the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="589" facs="tcp:48673:305"/>II. It is from hence alſo, that ſouls injoying the evidence of their union with the Lord Jeſus, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually groaning after a fuller meaſure of the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt, in what meaſure ſoever the ſanctifying ſpirit is poured out upon them. Thus <hi>David</hi> often in the 119. Pſalm begs for quickening; which in a word is but this, Lord ſend down more of the ſpirit of Life and Holineſs from the Lord Jeſus. Yea this you may obſerve from the workings of the ſpirit of the great Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Rom</hi> 7. how his ſoul groans after a larger portion of the ſanctifying ſpirit of Chriſt, complaining to will is preſent with him, but to do is not yet preſent, that when the law of the ſpirit begins to work, the law of the fleſh oppoſeth it, by which complaint he doth in effect but breath after a more mighty power of the ſanctifying ſpirit of Chriſt, which might not only beget a compliance in his will to the Lords holy will, but might alſo carry it forth to perfection, that might cauſe his ſoul not only to bring forth the bud of holineſs, but the ripe fruit of it, and his complaints are but the deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a power of the ſpirit, that the Law of the ſpirit, (that is the diſpoſition infuſed by the ſpirit) might overcome the Law of the members, (that is, the corrupt diſpoſitions that were naturally in him) ſo that his ſoul might be more then conquerer over Sin.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Hence alſo it is, that ſouls injoyning the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their union with Jeſus Chriſt from the ſpirit of Chriſt, are conſtantly enquiring into, and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to find out the ſecret Iniquities of their own hearts. That principle being firmly rooted in them by the ſpirit of Revelation (that diſcovers to them their union with Chriſt) that a perfect conformity
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:48673:306"/>
to the Lords will ought only to ſatisfie the deſires o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> any ſoul, Thence they being always conſcious to themſelves of a depth of wickedneſs that ſecretly poſſeſſeth their hearts, they are ſearching after the ſecret wickedneſs, thoſe vailed and incloſed iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that their hearts would even lock up as it were in dark Dungeons that the ſoul might never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Hence ſouls injoyning their evidence of their union with Chriſt, are calling in the aſſiſtance of the heart ſearching God to find out their Iniquities for them. According as you ſhall find <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 139.23, 24. <hi>Search me O God and know my heart, try me and know my thoughts</hi> (the holy mans meaning is, that the Lord ſhould ſo ſearch him as to make him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his own heart and to know his own thoughts) ſee if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlaſting. Thus he crys that the eye of the bleſſed Majeſty of heaven might pierce through his heart, to diſcover all his wickedneſs and contrary walkings to the will of God, that then God might ſend down a conquering power to deliver him from thoſe corruptions, and lead him into the path of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, that is, into a full conformity of the Lords bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed will.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Hence it is that ſouls injoying the evidence of their union with the Lord Jeſus, are ſo delighted with the precious heavenly light of the Lords word in its diſcovery of the Souls unholineſs, and in its diſcovery of the Lords bleſſed will concerning the Soul. Surely it was from hence that <hi>David</hi> (in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.10.) was ſo delighted with the Lords word, that he profeſſed it was ſweeter than the honey and the honey comb to him, becauſe it revealed the pretious
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:48673:306"/>
will of God to him, and diſcovered his own heart to him, and thence was a help to conform his will to the Lords bleſſed will, that was the only ſatisfying ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his Souls deſires.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Hence it is alſo, that Souls injoying the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their union with Chriſt, are ſo frequently breathing after the time of their diſſolution. It is in regard their Souls never attain the fulneſs of reſt, that ſatisfying object of their deſires, till the time of their diſſolution: Hence they groan being burdened with iniquity, and ſecretly cry out, O when ſhall I be worſhipping of God purely? When ſhall I be free from this body of ſin and death, that there may be a bleſſed union of Wills between thee and me, that this my vileſt corrupt will ſhall never oppoſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict thy will more? So that it is evident from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that the ſpirits revealing unto any ſoul its union with the Lord Jeſus, doth occaſion the ſoul neceſſarily to declare, that a perfect conformity to the Lords will, ought only to ſatisfy the deſires of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſoul.</p>
               <p>Yea likewiſe it is evident alſo from reaſon, that the ſpirits diſcovery of a ſouls union with Jeſus Chriſt, doth neceſſarily cauſe the ſoul it ſelf to be ſatisfied with no portion of holineſs but a full conformity to the Lords will.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In regard the ſpirits evidence of any ſouls union with Chriſt, doth cauſe the Soul to diſcern clearly, that a perfect conformity and ſubjection to the Lords will, is infinitely due from every creature. Whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that precious light ſhines from the ſpirit of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation into the ſoul, then the ſoul is filled with ſuch high thoughts of the tranſcendency of the Lords glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that thence the ſoul is convinced, that every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:48673:307"/>
in heaven and earth, owes abſolute, perfect ſubjection to the Lords bleſſed will: Now hence the ſoul cannot be ſatisfied with any degree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Lords will, leſs than an abſolute perfection of conformity: and likewiſe hence the ſoul is conſtrained to declare, that abſolute confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Lords will, ought only to be the center whereon the ſoul ſhould reſt.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſpirits revealing unto any ſoul its uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt, doth cauſe the ſoul to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ſo clearly the raviſhing beauty, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable luſtre of the holineſs of the Lords will, that thence a full ſubjection and conformity to the bleſſed holy will, appears as the higheſt thing that can be deſirable by any ſoul. That ſweeteſt diſcovery from the ſpirit of Chriſt unto a ſoul of its union with Chriſt, makes the ſoul appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Majeſty of Heaven to be ſo cloathed with a garment of love, and makes the ſoul ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend ſuch a height, and depth, and length and breadth of love to be in God towards forlorn unlovely ſinners, that thence the will of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in all things to be ſo good towards poor ſinners, as the very beauty of it makes a full conformity in that will in a manner infinitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by the ſoul. Yea the ſoul is then ſo ſtrongly convinced of the abſolute goodneſs of the bleſſed will of God in all its motions, that thence the ſoul can take no reſt nor contentment, while his will diſagreeth from that pureſt holy will that is ſo abſolutely good in all its motions.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The ſpirits revealing to any ſoul his union with Chriſt, doth eſtabliſh that bleſſed principle in the ſoul, that the moſt ſuperlative happineſs
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:48673:307" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of every ſoul conſiſts in perfect union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in Chriſt, the unity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of wills between God and the ſoul. Through the ſpirits light caſt into the dark ſoul, to diſcover the ſouls union with Chriſt, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly brightneſs, and glittering reſplendent Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Lords goodneſs ſo ſhines round about the ſoul, that thence the ſoul diſcerns clearly that that the higheſt and moſt ſupream degree of the happineſs of any ſoul, muſt neceſſarily conſiſt in the conjunction and communion of the ſoul with that infinite goodneſs, in the ſouls neareſt and largeſt participation of it. Thence that bleſſed principle is rooted in the ſoul, that the union and communion of wills between God and a Soul, is that top-ſtair of happineſs that any ſoul can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly aſcend to. Now thence, ſeeing happineſs is the object of the deſires of every ſoul naturally, the ſoul cannot be ſatisfied in it ſelf without a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect union of wills with that God in Chriſt, and perfect communion with him.</p>
               <p>So that thus it is evident, both from Scripture, from the experience of the manner of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and motions of the ſouls enjoying the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their union with Chriſt, and from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it ſelf, that the ſpirits evidence given unto any ſoul of its union with Chriſt, doth neceſſarily cauſe the ſoul to declare, that a perfect conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Lords will, ought to be the only ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying object of the Deſires of any ſoul. So that it is apparent that the bleſſed Name of God is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in every ſoul, in the glory and brightneſs of its tranſcendent holineſs to whom the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt doth revael its union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="594" facs="tcp:48673:308"/>Now I beſeech ye, you that are ſutable, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as hath been opened, to take a righteous and juſt examination of your evidence of union with Chriſt received) to try whether you can prove to your own ſouls, or demonſtrate from this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious reaſon, that your evidence of your union with Chriſt received, had God for its Father, and came down from Heaven only. But as I ſaid for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, ſo I ſay again, that I am confident that thoſe ſouls whom the ſpirit hath bleſſed with the ſpirit of wiſdom to diſcover to them their union with Chriſt, and with whom the ſpirit of light re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, thoſe ſouls have a teſtimony to their hearts and ſpirits of the real deſcention of the evidence of their union with Chriſt, from heaven, from this reaſon now opened. Certainly there is not a ſoul among us, to whom at preſent the ſpirit of Chriſt doth witneſs his union; but his own heart doth witneſs, that that very teſtimony of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt did cauſe the bleſſed Name of God thus to be exalted through his ſoul; there is not ſuch a ſoul certainly but his heart teſtifies that ever ſince he enjoyed that precious witneſs of the ſpirit, he hath born record and teſtimony to the world, he hath profeſſed apparently, verbally and practically, that a perfect conformity to the Lords pureſt holy will, ought only to ſatisfie the deſires of any ſoul: And queſtionleſs the ſoul alſo underſtands in ſome degree, that from thence hath proceeded the diſſatisfaction of his ſoul in all the pureſt acts of obedience to the Lords bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed will. Queſtionleſs the ſoul underſtands, that thence it hath been that he could not, but in his moſt holy duties (when moſt aſſiſted by the ſpirit
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:48673:308"/>
of Chriſt) be ſtill groaning under the ſenſe of his own unholineſs, under the ſenſe of his want of that largeneſs and fulneſs of the concurrence of his will with the Lords bleſſed will, and under the ſenſe of his want of freedom and liberty of ſpirit in his compliance with the Lords will, that he was convinced ought to have been in his ſoul: and queſtionleſs alſo that ſoul underſtands, that even from thence hath proceeded thoſe precious deſires that have ever ſince poſſeſſed his ſoul, after a larger portion of the ſanctifying ſpirit of Chriſt; and that ever ſince he hath always been ſearching after the ſecret iniquities of his own heart, and hath been appealing to the heart-ſearching God, to find them out for him; and hath been delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the diſcovery of the Lords will, and his diſagreement to that will. And queſtionleſs that ſoul underſtands ſenſibly, that ſince the ſpirit gave that teſtimony of his union with the Lord Jeſus, he hath had many ſtruglings with his ſpirit to be content to live, that he might be redeemed from the power of his contradicting will. Thus I doubt not but the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt alſo doth irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate the precious Goſpel-Truth, that the ſoul is able to prove to it ſelf the deſcent of its own evidence to be from heaven, that God was the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that his evidence. But yet here I muſt take in every confident ſoul without exception, that thereby the power of the Truth of Jeſus Chriſt might ſeize upon hearts. And,</p>
               <p n="1">1. I muſt deſire all ſouls that think they ſhall be everlaſtingly ſaved by Chriſt, to ſearch into their hearts, to know whether their apprehenſion of ſalvation by Chriſt did produce theſe bleſſed effects
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:48673:309"/>
in their hearts or no. I muſt appeal to your own Conſciences; Did your apprehenſions of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Chriſt infuſe that principle into your minds and hearts, that a perfect conformity to the Lords bleſſed holy will ought only to ſatisfie the deſires of any ſoul? Let Conſcience anſwer, Was this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed principle ſo rooted in your hearts by thoſe apprehenſions of ſalvation by Chriſt, that thence your hearts have been unſatisfied ever ſince, in your moſt holy actings, in thoſe acts of the pureſt obedience that ever you rendered to the Majeſty of heaven, that thence ever ſince you could not but be complaining (when your hearts were moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to any act of obedience) of the narrowneſs of your wills in compliance to God's will? And that you could not but be complaining of the want of ſingleneſs and uprightneſs, and ſimplicity of heart in every act of Obedience; yea, that you could not but be complaining of the want of freedom in your wills to comply with the Lords will, that you have ever ſince been groaning for want of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of your wills in that compliance, the want of facility and eaſineſs in your wills anſwering to the Lords bleſſed will. Souls, I can only call for Conſcience to anſwer; I beſeech you ſtop not its mouth, but let it give an Anſwer in the preſence of God, whether your hopes of ſalvation by Chriſt, did ſo root that principle in your hearts, that nothing could ſatisfie your ſouls, but a full conformity to the Lords will, ſo as you have been unſatisfied in the fulleſt acts of Obedience you have performed, that thence you have cauſed the Name of God to be exalted through you, that you have born witneſs to the world that the perfection
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:48673:309" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of holineſs dwells in God only, and all ought to bow down in ſubjection to that abſolute holy will of his.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I beſeech you try whether your apprehenſion of ſalvation by Chriſt did ſo ſweetly build your ſouls up in the belief of that great Truth, that no leſs than a perfect conformity to the Lords will ought to ſatisfie the deſires of any ſoul, that thence you have been perpetually groaning after a larger portion of the ſanctifying ſpirit of Chrit. What do your hearts anſwer? Have you not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied your ſelves with freedom from groſs ſins, and thought your condition ſhould be ſafe enough, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe free from the groſs pollutions of the world? And others of you, have you not ſatisfied your ſelves with holy duties, and thought you gained a ſufficient degree of holineſs, that your hearts ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver groaned after a larger portion?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Examine whether your apprehenſions of your ſalvation by Chriſt, did ever engrave that great Maxim in your hearts, that nothing ought to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie your ſouls but a full conformity to the Lords will, that thence you have ever ſince been enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and making diligent ſearch to find out the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den iniquities of your own hearts? Do not many of your Conſciences atteſt this before the Lord, that it was never made your work one moment to ſearch what iniquity was in your hearts undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Was ever your ſpirit ſo cauſed to apprehend, that nothing ought to ſatsfie your ſouls but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect conformity to the Lords will, by your appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of your being ſaved by Chriſt, that thence you have appealed to the Lord to be the trier and
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:48673:310" rendition="simple:additions"/>
examiner of your rotten deceitful hearts, to find out your Iniquities for you; that your wills might be brought into a more precious conformity to his bleſſed will? Did ever your ſouls breath forth one ſuch requeſt before the Lord to this day? Nay, let me ask you, whether you durſt now in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the heart-ſearching God, come to ſay, <hi>Lord, ſearch me, try me, ſee if there be any way of wickedneſs in me?</hi> If ſo, then how far are you from receiving the true evidence, whoſe deſcent is from heaven, whoſe Father is God, that evidence that proceeds from the ſpirit of Chriſt, of our union with Chriſt, and ſalvation by him?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Did ever your apprehenſions of your ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt, ſo confirm in your Souls that great Goſpel-Truth, that the Lords bleſſed will ought to have the moſt abſolute, perfect ſubjection from the will of any ſoul, that thence your Souls have delighted and taken contentment in the light of the Lords precious Truth revealing the Lords will to you, and revealing the diſagreement of your own wills to the Lords will? Are not your ſouls to this day ſo far from delighting in the diſcovery of the Lords will to your ſouls, as your ſpirits loath and hate thoſe bleſſed diſcoveries of the Lords will to you, and your hearts inwardly bulk and ſwell againſt the diſcoveries of the Lords will, that you have hard thoughts, and think if God require ſuch holineſs, ſuch praying, ſuch watching over the heart, words and thoughts, this is a hard Maſter indeed, to require ſuch ſtrictneſs as no holy heart can obſerve and anſwer: How then can you ſay confidently that you ſhall be ſaved by Chriſt, when your apprehenſions of ſalvation
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:48673:310" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by Chriſt, cannot teſtifie in the leaſt degree from this effect, of the cauſing the Name of God to be exalted through you, that the deſcent is from God?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Laſtly, Examine whether your apprehenſion of being ſaved by Chriſt, begat ſuch a principle in you, that nothing could ſatisfie you but a perfect conformity of your wills to the will of Chriſt? that your hearts have groaned after a diſſolution, after the time of breaking the corrupt union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Body and Soul, that you might no longer be detained under corruption, and a neceſſity of ſinning, that you might no longer have your wills oppoſite to the Lords will? Alas, do not your ſouls anſwer, that ſuch a time of diſſolution is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a time of horrour to your ſouls? Do not your hearts anſwer, that want of unity to the Lords will, is ſo little burdenſom to you, that could you dwell in your corrupt bodies, it would be accounted hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for ever, rather than that perfect union and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God in Chriſt? If your hearts anſwer any of theſe things, I beſeech you ſee how far you are from being able to prove to your own ſouls, that the apprehenſion of your ſalvation by Chriſt, did deſcend from God? Queſtionleſs did they proceed from God, they would cauſe the Name of God and his Holineſs to be exalted through you, they would cauſe your ſouls to bear record to the glory of the Lords holineſs, do teſtifie that ſuch a perfection of holineſs dwells in God, that his will ought to be the Rule for the conforming of the will of every Soul.</p>
